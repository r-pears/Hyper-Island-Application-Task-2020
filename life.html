    <h1>A New Life</h1>
    <p>
      Your trip to Canada went smoothly. You've been missing your family, and crying. You've also been crying of joy, you've gained your freedom,
      you're now in control of your own life. You have the backpack Mr. Ward gave you, with supplies to last you a while. You're also clinging
      to the letter of recommendation and your grades. Your chance at attending university, which has always been your dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      You step of the airplane, and the crisp cold hits you. You were not expecting it to be this cold! You knew it was going to be much colder here,
      but you didn't know what awaited you. Your breath becomes fog. You pull out a jacket from the bag and wear it. Much better.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ward had given you some names of friends of his that would be willing to help you out. You sought out a woman named Anne Carlson, and she
      took you into her home and gave you a room you could stay in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne is a woman in her mid 20's, slightly taller than average, with average build, she has short blonde hair, and green eyes. She's the first
      Caucasian woman you've ever talked to. You saw a few on the airplane but you didn't talk to anybody on your trip. Anne is very kind and funny,
      she has a warm personality.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are really happy living in Canada, but it also makes you feel guilty, that you left your family behind. That knowledge always weights heavily
      on your heart.
