    <h1>A Wedding?</h1>
    <p>
      You wake up one morning to screaming outside. You rub your eyes with your hands and put on some clothes and go outside to see what's going on.
      You lift your hand up to shield your eyes from the sun, you blink a couple of times to get used to the brightness. Your mother is arguing with
      a stranger. The stranger is middle-aged, tall, and broad shouldered. You are sure that you've never seen this man before, but there's still something
      familiar about his features. The man and your mother are yelling at each other as you're approaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can't do this!" your mother is furious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can do whatever I want!" the man yells back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I forbid you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's already decided!" the man's voice is cold and harsh, sending shivers down your spine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your mother shrinks down in front of the man, she falls to her knees, sobbing and pleading with the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please, you can't do this."
    </p>
    <p>
      You're frozen in place, watching the scene in front of you with fear. You have no idea what's going on, but you know that it's bad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your mother is crying, the man is looking down at your mother with disgust written on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please don't take my baby girl!" you feel like you're going to pass out when you realize that your mother means you.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man looks up, sees you, and gives you a smile that's supposed to be friendly, but to you it's only frightening.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is my child, I can do whatever I want" the words 'my child' keep echoing in your head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is this man the father you've never met?
      Your mother finally notices that you're watching the exchange. She looks up at you from her knees, tears streaming down her face.
      Her hands and knees are dirty, the dirt mixing with her tears and becoming muddy streaks on her clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      You realize what's going on, this is the day that you've been dreading for years. Your father is here to fetch you to get married, just
      like he's come for your sisters. You've never been home when your sisters have been picked up by your father, you look at him and you feel
      an anger building up inside of you. Anger for having abandoned your family, forced your sisters to leave your home, anger for never caring
      about you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your mother struggles to get up on her feet, and stumbles over to you and stands in front of you, keeping you half shielded behind her back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's only 15, don't take my baby from me." she begs your father.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's old enough, I've found a great husband for her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is he?" your mother demands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's an old friend of mine, you should be honored, girl" he tells you, looking into your eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why would I go with you?" you manage to finally speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because, I say so. You will be given a good life. Your husband is an engineer in the capitol."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Moma, I don't want to go." you whisper to your mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can feel her tensing up in front of you. She reaches behind her, and you take her hand,
      she squeezes it hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I let you take my other babies, but I've had enough." your mother says cooly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is none of your business, woman. She is my child, and she will get married."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I gave birth to her, I fed her, I rasied her. She is my child." your mother steps towards your father, her voice raising with every syllable.
    </p>
    <p>
      You see as in slow motion, your father raising his hand. Hand closing into a fist. Your mother flinching, trying to move away. You tense, ready to
      launch and stop your father. Time seems to stand still, you are unable to move. Your mother has an expression of disbelief and frighten.
      Then, as if someone snapped their fingers, time move again. Everything is as a blur in front of your eyes. It's only the sound that is clear,
      loud and audible.
    </p>
    <p>
      *SMACK*
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound of a fist hitting skin, this moment will haunt you for the rest of your life. The sound of your father's fist connecting with your mother's face,
      over and over again. This horrible sound is joined by the wimpers of your mother, producing something unimaginable, a sound that's so terrifying that you
      think that this cannot be real. It has to be some twisted nightmare that you're in. Of course, it's not, and it's really your father beating your mother.
      Until she's laying in a heap at his feet. You're frozen, unable to move, this moment, you know, you can feel it throughout your entire
      body, this moment will change your life forever. You will always carry the guilt with you, that your ma got hit because of you, to protect you.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now..." your father looks at you.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will come back in three days to get you, I expect there won't be a problem again." he says with contempt as he looks down at the lifeless form of your
      mother. Without another word, he turns away from the two of you, and gets into his truck and drives away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ma!" you scream and throw yourself down on the ground next to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      You shake her shoulders, but she isn't responsive. You managed to half carry and half drag
      her into your home, and onto her bed. You run as fast as you can, faster than you've ever run in your entire life. Your lungs are burning from exhaustion. You
      stop when you've reached your aunt's home, you bang on the wooden door. You hear some scraping noises inside, and a light *click* as the front door unlocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rosie! What's happened?" your aunt tries to drag you into her home.
    </p>
    <p>
      You open your mouth to tell her, but it's all coming back to you. It's overwhelming you, and you fall to the ground in a heap of sobs and snot.
      Susan hunches down beside you and strokes your head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rosie, did anybody hurt you?" Susan sounds increasingly concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ma..." the words barely come out of your mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Susan's head shoots up, and she looks at you.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rosie, what about Mary?" she sounds deadly serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can't think about it, you can't say it. You're just sitting on the ground sobbing and rocking back and forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mama? What's going on?" David appears in the doorway, obviously woken up from the commotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm going to Mary's. Take your cousin inside." Susan orders David, who clearly can read the seriousness in the situation and doesn't argue with his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gently picks you up and helps you inside, as his mother is rushing away towards your house.
    </p>
      David is very sweet to you, he doesn't ask you what has happened, he just offers you some tea and sits with you out on the porch. He's talking about things
      he's learned in school, and how he's going through with his plans to become a doctor. He is making you calm down, and you feel like you have to tell him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My father..." you begin to say, but your voice is raspy, so you clear your throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My father showed up this morning. Saying he's found me a great husband. Ma didn't want to let him take me, like he's come and taken away my sisters."
    </p>
    <p>
      David scrutinizes your expression and nods at you.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ma stepped between us, and he started beating her." your voice is trembling, but you manage to tell David, and the guilt washes over you again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He said he'll be back in three days. To come get me." you stare at your hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      There's a long silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rosie." he says softly. You look up to meet David's eyes, his kind eyes. David has always treated you like a little sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I assume you don't want to get married." he says.
    </p>
    <p>
      You shake your head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want to, but I don't really have a choice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You always have a choice Rosie." he looks at you with intensity.
    </p>
    <p>
      He continues "You know I always have and always will protect you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As I see it, you have two choices." you lean closer to David to hear what he has to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You either go with your father and get married, or you run away."
    </p>
    <p>
      'Run away?' the thought echoes in your head. David can't be serious?
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't run away, Ma would get in trouble. More than she already is, he'd probably kill her." you can barely get the words over your lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      David slowly nods. "That's why you'd have to run away after you've gone with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How would I do that? Would you help me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course." David gives you a warm smile, and for the first time you feel hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But..." he takes a deep breathe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you leave, you can never come back. You can never see your family or your mother again." he says in a serious tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you ever come back, your father would kill you. And your mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      You bite your lip hard, considering your options. Will you give up everything you've ever known and throw yourself into the unknown?
      You have no money and no way of providing for yourself. However, you'd be giving up on your dream of attending university. You
      would never be able to help people get a better future, or a better life. You would be giving up on everything you've ever dreamed about.
      No traveling around the world, seeing the beauty it has to offer. But leaving would mean that you're throwing yourself into the unknown,
      which is extremely scary.
      If you stay, you will be able to see your loved ones again. It is extremely
      hard to leave your family behind. Your heart is breaking in a thousand pieces, you don't know what decision to make.
    <p>
      What will you do? Run away and never see your loved ones again? Or refuse to get married and be on your own?
