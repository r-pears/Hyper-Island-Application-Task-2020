    <h1>Run Away</h1>
    <p>
      The three days are passing in a blur, you are torn about what to do. You love your family and you don't want to leave them and never see them again.
      However, you don't want to be forced to get married to a man that you've never met, and you most likely won't ever love that man.
      You know it's all a business transaction, your father will receive a decent sized dowry for you.
      You know that you're considered your father's possession and that he can do whatever he wants with you, and that you have no say in the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have decided to take control over your life and run away. You know it's going to be hard to never see your mother and sisters again, but you
      don't want this life. You want to do the things that you choose, and you have an extremely strong desire to see the world. It is your dream to
      travel around the world and see all that it has to offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the morning of the third day, you're kneeling by your mother's side when you hear a rustling behind you. You turn around and see David enter your
      home. You give him a nervous smile, and he looks at you seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you made up your mind?" he asks quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yeah, I want to leave."
    </p>
    <p>
      He nods slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have a plan." he says, "You can't leave before your father has come to fetch you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will follow you to the city, you'll have to find a way to sneak out of the house." he takes a deep breath, "Then I will hide you for a day."
    </p>
    <p>
      You open your mouth to protest, you know that David isn't allowed to have any female visitors at his room at the university. He stares intently
      at you and you close your mouth and keep listening to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have some money saved up that I will give you. It isn't much, but it is a start."
    </p>
    <p>
      You throw your arms around David's neck, hugging him tightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, you whisper in his ear."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, your father walks in behind you. He stops in his track when he sees the two of you, embracing each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What the hell is going on here?" he snarls at you, advancing towards you.
    </p>
    <p>
      He grabs your arm hard, and drags you out to his truck and pushes you inside. He walks around to the drivers side and gets in and slams the door behind him.
      You watch David run to his father's old beaten car, that he received when he got accepted to the university as a gift.
      Your father drives away, and the plan is in motion.
