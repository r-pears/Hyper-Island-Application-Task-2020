      <h1>Facts about UN Sustainable Development Goals(SDGs)</h1>
      <p id="factTag">
        This information comes from the <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainable development/sustainable-development-goals/">United Nations official homepage,</a>
        and from the <a href="https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals.html">SDGs official website.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        The SDGs is a part of the 2030 Agenda, which is a plan of action
        for people, planet, and prosperity.
        The United Nations(UN) created this agenda to strengthen universal peace
        through larger freedom.
        The SDGs seek to build on the Millennium Development Goals and
        complete what these did not achieve.
        Their purpose is to realize the human rights of all and to
        achieve gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls.
        The goals are integrated and indivisble and balance the three
        dimensions of sustainable development: the economic, social, and environmental.
        This is how the United Nations describe the SDGs:
        <blockquote id="citeQuote" cite="https://www.un.org/sustainable development/sustainable-development-goals/">
          "The Sustainable Development Goals are the blueprint to achieve a better and more
          sustainable future for all. They address the global challenges we face, including
          those related to poverty, inequality, climate change, environmental degradation,
          peace, and justice. The 17 Goals are all interconnected, and in order to leave
          no one behind, it is important that we achieve them all by 2030."
        </blockquote>
        This is the greatest global challenge of all
        time - to completely destroy poverty in all its shapes, even
        extreme poverty.
        It is an absolute necessity for sustainable development.
        It's important that all countries and stakeholders, work together
        in partnership, to implement and follow this Agenda. The ultimate goal
        is to free the human race from the tyranny of poverty.
        We only have one planet to live on, and we want it to
        last and be sustainable for future generations. Therefore, it is important
        to heal and secure our planet.
        For this to happen, transformative and bold steps are needed urgently.
        It will eventually shift the world onto a sustainable and resilient path.
        The UN's goal is that no one will be left behind.
        In total there are 17 Sustainable Development Goals, and 169 targets,
        and they show the ambition of the Agenda.
      </p>
      <h2>People</h2>
      <p>
        The goal is to end poverty and hunger, in all their forms and
        dimensions, and to ensure that all human beings can fulfil their
        potential in dignity and equality and in a healthy environment.
      </p>
      <h2>Planet</h2>
      <p>
        The goal is to protect the planet from degradation, including
        through sustainable consumption and production, sustainably managing its
        natural resources and taking urgent action on climate change, so that
        it can support the needs of the present and future generations.
      </p>
      <h2>Prosperity</h2>
      <p>
        The goal is to ensure that all human beings can enjoy prosperous and
        fulfillinf lives and that economic, social, and technological progress
        occurs in harmony with nature.
      </p>
      <h2>Peace</h2>
      <p>
        The goal is to foster peaceful, just, and inclusive societies which are
        free from fear and violence. There can be no sustainable development
        without peace and no peace without sustainable development.
      </p>
      <h2>Partnership</h2>
      <p>
        The goal is to mobilize the means required to implement this Agenda
        through a revitalised Global Partnership for Sustainable Development,
        based on a spirit of strengthened global solidarity, focused in particular
        on the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable with the participation
        of all countries, stakeholders, and all people.
        The interlinkages and integrated nature of the Sustainable Development Goals
        are of crucial importance in ensuring that the purpose of the new Agenda
        is realised. If we realize our ambitions across the full extent of
        the Agenda, the lives of all will be profoundly improved and our
        world will be transformed for the better.

    <div class="goal1">
      <h2 id="goals1">Goal 1 - No Poverty</h2>
      <p class="goalTag">
        End poverty in all its form everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eradicating poverty in all its forms remains one of the greatest challenges facing humanity.
        While the number of people living in extreme poverty dropped by more than half between 1990
        and 2015, to many are still struggling for the most basic human needs.
        As of 2015, about 736 million people still lived on less than US$1.90 a day;
        many lack food, clean drinking water and sanitation. Rapid growth in countries such
        as China and India has lifted millions out of poverty, but progress has been uneven.
        Women are more likely to be poor than men because they have less paid work, education,
        and own less property.
        Progress has also been limited in other regions such as South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa,
        which account for more than 80 percent of those living in extreme poverty. New threats
        brought on by climate change, conflict and food insecurity, mean even more work is
        needed to bring people out of poverty.
        The SDGs are a bold commitment to finish what we started, and end poverty in all forms and
        dimensions by 2030. This involves targeting the most vulnerable, increasing basic
        resources and services, and supporting communities affected by conclict and climate-related
        disasters.
      </p>
      <h3>Facts and Figures</h3>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>To date there are more than 700 million people, or 10% of the world population,
              that still live in extreme poverty. Surviving on less than US$1.90 a day.</li>
          <li>Having a job does not guarantee a decent living. In fact, 8% of employed workers
              and their families worldwide lived in extreme poverty in 2018.</li>
          <li>Globally, there are 122 women aged 25 to 34 living in extreme poverty for
              every 100 men of the same age group.</li>
          <li>The majority of people living on less than $1.90 a day live in sub-Saharan
              Africa.</li>
          <li>High poverty rates are often found in small, fragile and conflict-affected countries.</li>
          <li>Poverty affects children disproportionately. One out of five children live in extreme poverty.</li>
          <li>As of 2018, 55% of the world's population have no access to social protection.</li>
          <li>In 2018, only 41% of women giving birth received maternity cash benefits.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
      <p>
        There are many reasons but in short, because as human beings, our well-being
        is linked to each other. Growing inequality is detrimental to economic growth
        and undermines social cohesion, increasing political and social tension and, in some
        circumstances, driving instabilities and conflicts.
        Economic growth must be inclusive to provide sustainable jobs and promote equality.
      </p>
      <h3>Goal Targets</h3>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>1.1 By 2030, eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere,
          currently measured as people living on less than $1.25 a day.</li>
          <li>1.2 By 2030, reduce at least by half the proportion of men, women and children of
          all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions.</li>
          <li>1.3 Implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all,
          including, floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable.</li>
          <li>1.4 By 2030, ensure that all men and women, in particular the poor and the vulnerable, have
          equal rights to economic resources as well as access to basic services, ownership and control
          over land and other forms of property, inheritance, natural resources, appropriate new technology
          and financial services, including microfinance.</li>
          <li>1.5 By 2030, build the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations and reduce their
          exposure and vulnerability to climate-related extreme events and other economic, social and
          environmental shocks and disasters.</li>
          <li>1.A Ensure significant mobilization of resources from a variety of sources, including through enhanced
          development cooperation, in order to provide adequate and predictable means for developing countries,
          in particular least developed countries, to implement programmes and policies to end poverty in all its
          dimensions.</li>
          <li>1.B Create sound policy frameworks at the national, regional and international levels,
          based on pro-poor and gender-sensitive development strategies, to support accelerated investment
          in poverty eradication actions.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>What can you do to help?</h3>
      <p>
        Your active engagement in policymaking can make a difference in addressing poverty.
        It ensures that your rights are promoted and that your voice is heard, that
        inter-generational knowledge is shared, and that innovation and critical thinking
        are encourages at all ages to support transformational change in people's lives and communities.
        Governments can help create an enabling environment to generate productive employment and job
        opportunities for the poor and marginalized. They can formulate strategies and fiscal policies
        that stimulate pro-poor growth, and reduce poverty.
        The private sector, as an engine of economic growth, has a major role to play in determining
        whether the growth it creates is inclusive and hence contributes to poverty reduction. It can promote
        economic opportunities for the poor, focusing on segments of the economy where most of the poor
        are active, namely on micro and small enterprises and those operating in the informal sector.
        The academic and education community have a major role in increasing the awareness about the impact
        of poverty. Science provides the foundation for new and sustainable approaches, solutions and technologies
        to tackle the challenges of reducing poverty and achieving sustainable development. The contribution of
        science to end poverty has been significant. For example, it has enabled access to safe drinking water,
        reduced deatgs caused by water-borne diseases, and improved hygiene to reduce health risks related
        to unsafe drinking water and lack of sanitation.

      <h2 id="goals2">Goal 2 - Zero Hunger</h2>
      <p class="goalTag">
        End hunger, achieve food security and imporoved nutrition and promote
        sustainable agriculture.
      </p>
      <p>
        The number of undernourished people has droppped by almost half in the past two decades because of rapid
        economic growth and increased agricultural productivity. Many developing countries that used to suffer from famine
        and hunger can now meet their nutritional needs. Central and East Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean have
        all made huge progress in eradicating extreme hunger.
        Unfortunately, extreme hunger and malnutrition remain a huge barrier to development in many countries. There
        are 821 million people estimated to be chronically undernourished as of 2017, often as a direct consequence
        of environmental degradation, drought and biodiversity loss. Over 90 million children under five are
        dangerously underweight. Undernourishment and severe food insecurity appear to be increasing in almost all
        regions of Africa, as well as in South America.
        The SDGs aim to end all forms of hunger and malnutrition by 2030, making sure all people - especially children -
        have sufficient and nutritious food all year. This involves promoting sustainable agriculture, supporting
        small-scale farmers and equal access to land, technology and markets. It also requires international
        cooperation to ensure investment in infrastructure and technology to improve agricultural productivity.
      </p>
      <h3>Facts and Figures</h3>
      <p>
        <h4>Hunger</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>An estimated 821 million people were undernourished in 2017.</li>
          <li>The majority of the world's hungry people live in developing countries, where 12.9 percent of the population
          is undernourished.</li>
          <li>Sub-Saharan Africa remains the region with the highest prevalence of hunger, with the rate increasing
          from 20.7 percent in 2014 to 23.2 percent in 2017.</li>
          <li>In sub-Saharan Africa, the number of undernourished people increased from 195 million in 2014 to 237
          million in 2017.</li>
          <li>Poor nutrition causes nearly half (45 percent) of deaths in children under five - 3.1 million
          each year.</li>
          <li>149 million children under 5 years of age - 22 percent of the global under-5 population - were
          still chronically undernourished in 2018.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Food Security</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Agriculture is the single largest employer in the world, providing livelihoods for 40 percent of
          today's global population. It is the largest source of income and jobs for poor rural households.</li>
          <li>500 million small farms worldwide, most still rainfed, provide up to 80 percent of food consumed in a
          large part of the developing world. Investing in smallholder women and men is an important way to increase
          food security and nutrition for the poorest, as well as food production for local and global markets.</li>
          <li>Since the 1900s, some 75 percent of crop diversity has been lost from farmers' fields.
          Better use of agricultural biodiversity can contribute to more nutritious diets, enhanced livelihoods for
          farming communities and more resilient and sustainable farming systems.</li>
          <li>If women farmers had the same access to resources as men, the number of hungry in the world
          could be reduced by up to 150 million.</li>
          <li>840 million people have no access to electricity worldwide - most of whom live in rural areas
          of the developing world. Energy poverty in many regions is a fundamental barrier to
          reducing hunger and ensuring that the world can produce enough food to meet future demand.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>Goal Targets</h3>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>2.1 By 2030, end hunger and ensure access by all people, in particular the poor and people in vulnerable
          situations, including infants, to safe, nutritious and sufficient food all year round.</li>
          <li>2.2 By 2030, end all forms of malnutrition, including achieving, by 2025, the internationally agreed
          targets on stunting and wasting in children under 5 years of age, and address the nutritional needs of
          adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating women and older persons.</li>
          <li>2.3 By 2030, double the agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers, in particular
          women, indigenous peoples, family farmers, pastoralists and fishers, including through secure and equal access to
          land, other productive resources and inputs, knowledge, financial services, markets and opportunities for
          value addition and non-farm employment.</li>
          <li>2.4 By 2030, ensure sustainable food production systems and implement resilient agricultural practices that
          increase productivity and production, that help maintain exosystems, that strengthen capacity for adaptation to
          climate change, extreme weather, drought, flooding and other disasters and that progressively improve land and soil
          quality.</li>
          <li>2.5 By 2020, maintain the genetic diversity of seeds, cultivated plants and farmed and domesticated animals
          and their related wild species, including through soundly managed and diversified seed and plant banks at the national, regional
          and international levels, and promote access to and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of genetic
          resources and associated traditional knowledge, as internationally agreed.</li>
          <li>2.A Increase investment, including through enhanced international cooperation, in rural infrastructure, agricultural
          research and extension services, technology development and plant and livestock gene banks in order to enhance agricultural
          productive capacity in developing countries, in particular least developed countries.</li>
          <li>2.B Correct and prevent trade restrictions and distortions in world agricultural markets, including through the parallel
          elimination of all forms of agricultural export subsidies and all export measures with equivalent effect, in accordance
          with the mandate of the Doha Development Round.</li>
          <li>2.C Adopt measures to ensure proper functioning of food commodity markets and their derivatives and
          facilitate timely access to market information, including on food reserves, in order to help limit extreme
          food price volatility.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
      <p>
        We all want our families to have enough food to eat what is safe and nutritious. A world with zero hunger can positively
        impact our economies, health, education, equality and social development.
        It's a key piece of building a better future for everyone. Additionally, with hunger limiting human development,
        we will not be able to achieve the other sustainable development goals such as education, health and gender equality.
        The food and agriculture sector offers key solutions for development,
        and is central for hunger and poverty eradication.
      </p>
      <h3>What can you do to help?</h3>
      <p>
        You can make changes in your own life - at home, at work and in the community - by supporting local farmers or markets
        and making sustainable food choices, supporting good nutrition for all, and fighting food waste.
        You can also use your power as a consumer and voter, demanding businesses and governments make the choices and changes
        that will make Zero Hunger a reality. Join the conversation, whether on social media platforms or in your local communities.

      <h2 id="goals3">Goal 3 - Good Health and Well-being</h2>
      <p class="goalTag">
        Ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeind for all at all ages.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have made great progress against several leading causes of death and disease. Life expectancy has increased dramatically;
        infant and maternal mortality rates have declined, we've turned the tide on HIV and malaria deaths have halved.
        Good health is essential to sustainable development and the 2030 Agenda reflects the complexity and internconnectedness of
        the two. It takes into account widening economic and social inequalities, rapid urbanization, threats to the climate and the
        environment, the continuing burden of HIV and other infectious diseases, and emerging challenges such as noncommunicable
        diseases. Universal health coverage will be integral to achieving SDG 3, ending poverty and reducing inequalities. Emerging
        global health priorities not explicitly included in the SDGs, including antimicrobial resistance, also demand action.
        But the world is off-track to achieve the health-related SDGs. Progress has been uneven, both between and within countries.
        There's a 31-year gap between the countries with the shortest and longest life expectancies. And while some countries have made
        impressive gains, national averages hide that many are being left behind. Multisectoral, rights-based and gender-sensitive
        approaches are essential to address inequalities and to build good health for all.
      </p>
      <h3>Facts and Figures</h3>
      <p>
        <h4>Child Health</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>17,000 fewer children die each day than in 1990, but more than five million children still die before their
          fifth birthday each year.</li>
          <li>Since 2000, measles vaccines have averted nearly 15.6 million deaths.</li>
          <li>Despite determined global progress, an increasing proportion of child deaths in Sub-Saharan Africa
          and Southern Asia. Four out of every five deaths of children under age five occur in these regions.</li>
          <li>Children born into poverty are almost twice as likely to die before the age of five as those
          from wealthier families.</li>
          <li>Children of educated mothers - even mothers with only primary schooling - are more likely to survive
          than children of mothers with no education.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Maternal Health</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Maternal mortality has fallen by 37% since 2000.</li>
          <li>In Eastern Asia, North Africa and Southern Asia, maternal mortality has declined by around two-thirds.</li>
          <li>But maternal mortality ratio - the proportion of mothers that do not survive childbirth compared
          to those who do - in developing regions is still 14 times higher than in the developed regions.</li>
          <li>More women are receiving antenatal care. In developing regions, antenatal care increased from 65 percent
          in 1990 to 83 percent in 2012.</li>

      <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
      <p>
        Ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages is important to building prosperous societies.
        Major progress has been made in improving the health of millions of people. Maternal and child mortality rates have been reduced,
        life expectancy continues to increase globally, and the fight against some infectious diseases has made steady profress.
        However, in the case of other diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis, progress has slowed or stalled.
        At least half the world's population are still without access to essential health services.
        In rich and poor countries alike, a health emergency can push people into bankruptcy or poverty.
        Concentrated efforts are required to achieve universal health coverage and sustainable financing for health;
        address the growing burden och noncommunicable diseases, tackle antimicrobial resistance and environmental
        factors contributing to ill health.
      </p>
      <h3>What can you do to help?</h3>
      <p>
        You can start by promoting and protecting your own health and the health of those around you, by making well-informed
        choices, practicing safe sex and vaccinating your children.
        You can raise awareness in your community about the importance of good health, healthy lifestyles as well as people's
        rights to quality health care services, especially for the most vulnerable such as women and children.
        You can also hold your government, local leaders, and other decision-makers accountable to their commitments to improve
        people's access to health and health care.

      <h2 id="goal4">Goal 4 - Quality Education</h2>
      <p class="goalTag">
        Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning
        opportunities for all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since 2000, there has been enormous progress in achieving the target of universal primary education. The total enrolment rate
        in developing regions reached 91 percent in 2015, and the worldwide number of children out of school has dropped by almost
        half. There has also been a dramatic increase in literacy rates, and many more girls are in schoool than ever before.
        These are all remarkable successes.
        Progress has also been tough in some developing regions due to high levels of poverty, armed conflicts and other emergencies.
        In Western Asia and North Africa, ongoing armed conflict has seen an increase in the number of children out of school.
        This is a worrying trend. While sub-Saharan Africa made the greatest progress in primary school enrolment among all developing
        regions - from 52 percent in 1990, up to 78 percent in 2012 - large disparities still remain. Children from the poorest
        households are up to four times more likely to be out of school than those of the richest households. Disparities between
        rural and urban areas also remain high.
        Achieving inclusive and quality education for all reaffirms the belief that education is one of the most powerful and proven
        vehicles for sustainable development. This goal ensures that all girls and boys complete free primary and secondary schooling
        by 2030. It also aims to provide equal access to affordable vocational training, to eliminate gender and wealth disparities,
        and achieve universal access to a quality higher education.

      <h3>Facts and Figures</h3>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Enrolment in primary education in developing countries has reached 91 percent but 57 million
          primary age children remain out of school.</li>
          <li>More than half of children that have not enrolled in school live in sub-Saharan Africa.</li>
          <li>An estimated 50 percent of out-of-school children of primary school age live in conflict-affected areas.</li>
          <li>617 million youth worldwide lack basic mathematics and literacy skills.</li>

          literacy and numeracy.</li>
          <li>4.7 By 2030, ensure that all learners acquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable
          development, including, among others, through education for sustainable development and sustainable lifestyles,
          human rights, gender equality, promotion of a culture of peace and non-violence, global citizenship and
          appreciation of cultural diversity and of culture's contribution to sustainable development.</li>
          <li>4.A Build and upgrade education facilities that are child, disability and gender sensitive and provide
          safe, nonviolent, inclusive and effective learning environments for all.</li>
          <li>4.B By 2020, substantially expand globally the number of scholarships available to developing countries,
          in particular least developed countries, small island developing States and African countries, for enrolment in higher
          and scientific programmes, in developed countries and other developing countries.</li>

      <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
      <p>
        Education enables upward socioeconomic mobility and is a key to escaping property. Education is also essential to achieving
        many other SDGs.
        When people are able to get quality education they can break from the cycle of poverty. Education helps to reduce
        inequalities and to reach gender equality. In fact, one extra year of education is associated with a reduction
        of the Gini coefficient by 1.4 percentage points.
        Education empowers people everywhere to live more healthy and sustainable lives. Education is also crucial
        to fostering tolerance between people and contributes to more peaceful societies.
      </p>
      <h3>What can you do to help?</h3>
      <p>
        Ask our governments to place education as a priority in both policy and practice. Lobby our goverments to make
        firm commitments to provide free primary school education to all, including vulnerable and marginalized groups.
        Encourage the private sector to invest resources in the development of educational tools and facilities. Urge NGOs to partner
        with youth and other groups to foster the importance of education within local communities.

        Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ending all discrimination against women and girls is not only a basic human right, it's crucial for sustainable future;
        it's proven that empowering women and girls helps economic growth and development.
        UNDP has made gender equality central to its work and we've seen remarkable progress in the past 20 years. There are
        more girls in school now compared to 15 years ago, and most regions have reached gender parity in primary education.
        But although there are more women than ever in the labour markets, there are still large inequalities in some regions,
        with women systematically denied the same work rights as men. Sexual violence and exploitation, the unequal division of
        unpaid care and domestic work, and discrimination in public office all remain huge barriers. Climate change and disasters
        continue to have a disproportionate effect on women and children, as do conflict and migration.
        It is vital to give women equal rights land and property, sexual and reproductive health, and to technology and the Internet.
        Today there are more women in public office than ever before, but encouraging more women leaders will help achieve greater
        gender equality.

      <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
      <p>
        Regardless of where you live, gender equality us a fundamental human right. Advancing gender equality is critical
        to all areas of a healthy society, from reducing poverty to promoting health, education, protection and the well-being
        of girls and boys. Investing in education programmes for girls and increasing the age at which they marry can return $5
        for every dollar spent. Investing in programs improving income-generating activities for women can return $7 dollars
        for every dollar spent.
        Gender equality is not only a fundamental human right, but a necessary
        foundation for a peaceful, prosperous, and sustainable world.
      </p>
      <h3>What can you do to help?</h3>
      <p>
        If you are a girl, you can stay in school, help empower your female classmates to do the same and fight for your
        right to access sexual and reproductive health services. If you are a woman, you can address unconscious biases
        and implicit associations that form an unintended and often invisble barrier to equal opportunity.
        If you are a man or a boy, you can work alongside women and girls to achieve gender equality and embrace healthy,
        respectful relationships.
        You can fund education campaigns to curb cultural practices like female genital mutilation and change harmful laws that
        limit the rights of women and girls and prevent them from achieving their full potential.

      <p class="goalTag">
        Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Between 2000 and 2016, the number of people with electricity increased from 78 to 87 percent, and the numbers without
        electricity dipped to just below 1 billion.
        Yet as the population continues to grow, so will the demand for cheap energy, and an economy reliant on fossil fuels is
        creating drastic changes to our climate.
        Investing in solar, wind and thermal power, improving energy productivity, and ensuring energy for all is vital if we are
        to achieve SDG 7 by 2030.
        Expanding infrastructure and upgrading technology to provide clean and more efficient energy in all countries will
        encourage growth and help the environment.
      </p>
      <h3>Facts and Figures</h3>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>13% of the global population still lacks access to modern electricity.</li>
          <li>3 billion people rely on wood, coal, charcoal or animal waste for cooking and heating.</li>
          <li>Energy is the dominant contributor to climate change, accounting for around 60 percent of total global
          greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
          <li>Indoor air pollution from using combustible fuels for household energy caused 4.3 million deaths in 2012,
          with women and girls accounting for 6 out of every 10 of these.</li>
          <li>The share of renewable energy in final energy consumption has reached 17.5% in 2015.</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>Goal Targets</h3>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>7.1 By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services.</li>
          <li>7.2 By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix.</li>
          <li>7.3 By 2030, double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency.</li>

          landlocked developing countries, in accordance with their respective programmes of support.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
      <p>
        For many decades, fossil fuels such as coal, oil or gas have been major sources of electricity production,
        but burning carbon fuels produces large amounts of greenhouse gases which cause climate change and have harmful
        impacts on people's well-being and the environment. This affects everyone, not just a few. Moreover, global electricity
        use is rising rapidly. In a nutshell, without a stable electricity supply, countries will not be able to power their
        economies.
        Energy is central to nearly every major challenge and opportunity.
      </p>
      <h3>What can you do to help?</h3>
      <p>
        Countries can accelerate the transition to an affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy system by investing in
        renewable energy resources, prioritizing energy efficient practices, and adopting clean energy technologies and
        infrastructure. Businesses can maintain and protect ecosystems to be able to use and further develop hydropower
        sources of electricity and bioenergy, and commit to sourcing 100% of operational electricity needs from renewable
        sources.
        Employers can reduce the internal demand for transport by prioritizing telecommunications and incentivize less energy
        intensive modes such as train travel over auto and air travel. Investors can invest more in sustainable energy services,
        bringing new technologies to the market quickly from a diverse supplier base.
        You can save electricity by plugging appliances into a power strip and turning them off completely when not in use,
        including your computer. You can also bike, walk or take public transport to reduce carbon emissions.

      <p class="goalTag">
        Promote sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, full
        and productive employment and decent work for all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the past 25 years the number of workers living in extreme poverty has declined dramatically, despite the lasting
        impact of the 2008 economic crisis and global recession. In developing countries, the middle class now makes up more than
        34 percent of total employment - a number that has almost tripled between 1991 and 2015.
        However, as the global economy continues to recover we are seeing slower growth, widening inequalities, and not enough
        jobs to keep up with a growing labour force. According to the International Labour Organization, more than 204 million
        people were unemployed in 2015.
        The SDGs promote sustained economic growth, higher levels of productivity and technological innovation. Encouraging entrepreneurship
        and job creation are key to this, as are effective measures to eradicate forced labour, slavery and human trafficking. With
        these targets in mind, the goal is to achieve full and productive employment, and decent work, for all women and men by 2030.
      </p>
      <h3>Facts and Figures</h3>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>The global unemployment rate in 2017 was 5.6%, down from 6.4% in 2000.</li>
          <li>Globally, 61% of all workers were engaged in informal employment in 2016. Excluding the agricultural sector,
          51% of all workers fell into this employment category.</li>
          <li>Men earn 12.5% more than women in 40 out of 45 countries with data.</li>
          <li>The global gender pay gap stands at 23 percent globally and without decisive action, it will take another
          68 years to achieve equal pay. Women's labour force participation rate is 63 percent while that of men is 94
          percent.</li>
          <li>Despite their increasing presence in public life, women continue to do 2.6 times the unpaid care and domestic
          work that men do.</li>
          <li>470 million jobs are needed globally for new entrants to the labour market between 2016 and 2030.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>Goal Targets</h3>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>8.1 Sustain per capita economic growth in accordance with national circumstances and, in particular, at least
          7 percent gross domestic product growth per annum in the least developed countries.</li>
          <li>8.2 Achieve higher levels of economic productivity through diversification, technological upgrading and innovation,

          <li>8.3 Promote development-orientated policies that support productive activities, decent job creation, entrepreneurship,
          creativity and innovation, and encourage the formalization and growth of micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises,
          including through access to financial services.</li>
          <li>8.4 Improve progressively, through 2030, global resource efficiency in consumption and production and
          endeavour to decouple economic growth from environmental degradation, in accordance with the 10-year framework of
          programmes on sustainable consumption and production, with developed countries taking the lead.</li>
          <li>8.5 By 2030, achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men, including
          for young people and persons with disabilities, and equal pay for work of equal value.</li>
          <li>8.6 By 2020, substantially reduce the proportion of youth not in employment, education or training.</li>
          <li>8.7 Take immediate and effective measures to eradicate forced labour, end modern slavery and human trafficking
          and secure the prohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child labour, including recruitment and use of
          child soldiers, and by 2030 end child labour in all its forms.</li>
          <li>8.8 Protect labour rights and promote safe and secure working environments for all workers, including migrant
          workers, in particular women migrants, and those in precarious employment.</li>
          <li>8.9 By 2030, devise and implement policies to promote sustainable tourism that creates jobs and promotes

          Jobs Pact of the International Labour Organization.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
      <p>
        Society as a whole benefits when more people are being productive and contributing to their country's growth.
        Productive employment and "decent work" are key elements to achieving fair globalization and poverty reduction.
        In addition, unemployment can lead to unrest and disrupt peace if it is left unaddressed.
        Sustainable economic growth will require societies to create the conditions
        that allow people to have quality jobs.
      </p>
      <h3>What can you do to help?</h3>
      <p>
        Providing youth the best opportunity to transition to a decent job calls for investing in education and training of the
        highest possible quality, providing youth with skills that match labour market demands, giving them access to social
        protection and basic services regardless of their contract type, we well as levelling the playing field so that all
        aspiring youth can attain productive employment regardless of their gender, income level or socioeconomic background.
        Governments can work to build dynamic, sustainable, innovative and people-centred economies, promoting youth employment
        and women's economic empowerment, in particular, and decent work for all. Local authorities and communities can renew
        and plan their cities and human settlements so as to foster community cohesion and personal security and to stimulate
        innovation and employment.

      <p>
        Investment in infrastructure and innovation are crucial drivers of economic growth and development. With over half the world
        population now living in cities, mass transport and renewable energy are becoming ever more important, as are the growth
        of new industries and information and communication technologies.
        Technological progress is also key to finding lasting solutions to both economic and environmental challenges, such as providing
        new jobs and promoting energy efficiency. Promoting sustainable industries, and investing in scientific research and innovation,
        are all important ways to facilitate sustainable development.
        More than 4 billion people still do not have access to the Internet, and 90 percent are from the developing world. Bridging
        this digital divide is crucial to ensure equal access to information and knowledge, as well as foster innovation and
        entrepreneurship.
      </p>
      <h3>Facts and Figures</h3>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Basic infrastructure like roads, information and communication technologies, sanitation, electrical power and
          water remains scarce in many developing countries.</li>
          <li>16% of the global population does not have access to mobile broadband networks.</li>
          <li>For many African countries, particularly the lower-income countries, the existent contraints regarding
          infrastructure affect firm productivity by around 40 percent.</li>
          <li>The global share of manufacturing value added in GDP increased from 15.2% in 2005 to 16.3% in 2017,
          driven by the fast growth of manufacturing in Asia.</li>
          <li>Industrialization's job multiplication effect has a positive impact on society. Every job in manufacturing creates
          2.2 jobs in other sectors.</li>
          <li>Small and medium-sized enterprises that engage in industrial processing and manufacturing are the most critical for the
          early stages of industrialization and are typically the largest job creators. They make up over 90 percent of business
          worldwide and account for between 50-60 percent of employment.</li>
          <li>Least developed countries have immense potential for industrialization in food and beverages (agro-industry), and
          textiles and garments, with good prospects for sustained employment generation and higher productivity.</li>
          <li>Middle-income countries can benefit from entering the basic and fabricated metals industries, which offer a range of products
          facing rapidly growing international demand.</li>
          <li>In developing countries, barely 30 percent of agricultural production undergoes industrial processing. In high-income
          countries, 98 percent is processed. This suggests that there are great opportunities for developing countries

      <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
      <p>
        Inclusive and sustainable industrialization, together with innovation and infrastructure, can unleash
        dynamic and competitive economic forces that generate employment and income. They play a key role in introducing
        and promoting new technologies, facilitating international trade and enabling the efficient use of resources.
        The growth of new industries means improvement in the standard of living for many of us.
        Also, if industries pursue sustainability, this approach will have a positive effect on the environment.
        Climate change affects all of us.

      <h2 id=goals10>Goal 10 - Reduced Inequalities</h2>
      <p class="goalTag">
        Reduce inequality within and among countries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Income inequality is on the rise - the richest 10 percent have up to 40 percent of global income whereas
        the poorest 10 percent earn only between 2 to 7 percent. If we take into account population growth inequality
        in developing countries, inequality has increased by 11 percent.
        Income inequality has increased in nearly everywhere in recent decades, but at different speeds. It's lowest
        in Europe and highest in the Middle East.
        These widening disparities require sound policies to empower lower income earners, and promote economic inclusion
        of all regardless of sex, race or ethnicity.
        Income inequality requires global solutions. This involves improving the regulation and monitoring of financial
        markets and institutions, encouraging development assistance and foreign direct investment to regions where the
        need is greatest. Facilitating the safe migration and mobility of people is also key to bridging the widedning

      <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
      <p>
        In today's world, we are all interconnected. Problems and challenges, be they poverty, climate change, migration
        or economic crises are never just confined to one country or region. Even the richest countries still have communities
        living in abject poverty. The oldest democracies still wrestle with racism, homophobia and transphobia, and
        religious intolerance. Global inequality affects us all, no matter who we are or where we are from.
        To reduce Inequalities, policies should be universal in principle, paying
        attention to the needs of disadvantaged and marginalized populations.
      </p>
      <h3>What can you do to help?</h3>
      <p>
        Reducing inequality requires transformative change. Greater efforts are needed to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger,
        and invest more in health, education, social protection and decent jobs especially for young people, migrants
        and other vulnerable communities.
        Within countries, it is important to empower and promote inclusive social and economic growth. We can ensure equal
        opportunity and reduce inequalities of income if we eliminate discriminatory laws, policies and practices.
        Among countries, we need to ensure that developing countries are better represented in decisionmaking on global issues
        so that solutions can be more effective, credible and accountable.
        Governments and other stakeholders can also promote safe, regular and responsible migration, including through planned
        and well-managed policies, for the millions of people who have left their homes seeking better lives due to war,
        discrimination, poverty, lack of opportunity and other drivers of migration.

          health.</li>
          <li>As of 2016, 90% of urban dwellers have been breathing unsafe air, resulting in 4.2 million deaths due to ambient

      <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
      <p>
        All these issues will eventually affect every citizen. Inequality can lead to unrest and insecurity, pollution deteriorates everyone's
        health and affects worker's productivity and therefore the economy, and natural disasters have the potential to disrupt everyone's
        lifestyles.
        There needs to be a future in which cities provide opportunities
        for all, with access to basic services, energy, housing, transportation
        and more.
      </p>
      <h3>What can you do to help?</h3>
      <p>
        Take an active interest in the governance and management of your city. Advocate for the kind of city you believe you need.
        Develop a vision for your building, street, and neighbourhood, and act on that vision. Are there enough jobs? Can your
        children walk to school safely? Can you walk with your family at night? How far is the nearest public transport? What's
        the air quality like? What are your shared public spaces like? The better the conditions you create in your community,
        the greater the effect on quality of life.

      <h2 id="goals12">Goal 12 - Responsible Consumption and Production</h2>
      <p class="goalTag">
        Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
        Achieving economic growth and sustainable development requires that we urgently reduce our ecological footprint
        by changing the way we produce and consume goods and resources. Agriculture is the biggest user of water worldwide,
        and irrigation now claims close to 70 percent of all freshwater for human use.
        The efficient management of our shared natural resources, and the way we dispose of toxic waste and pollutants,
        are important targets to achieve this goal. Encouraging industries, businesses and consumers to recycle and reduce
        waste is equally important, as is supporting developing countries to move towards more sustainable patterns of
        consumption by 2030.
        A large share of the world population is still consuming far too little to meet even their basic needs. Halving
        the per capita of global food waste at the retailer and consumer levels is also important for creating more efficient
        production and supply chains. This can help with food security, and shift us towards a more resource efficient
        economy.
      </p>
      <h3>Facts and Figures</h3>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Should the global population reach 9.6 billion by 2050, the equivalent of almost three planets could be required
          to provide the natural resources needed to sustain current lifestyles.</li>
          <li>With rises in the use of non-metallic minerals within infrastructure and construction, there has been
          significant improvement in the material standard of living. The per capita "material footprint" of developing countries
          increased from 5 metric tons in 2000 to 9 metric tons in 2017.</li>
          <li>93% of the world's 250 largest companies are now reporting on sustainability.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Water</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Less than 3 percent of the world's water is fresh (drinkable), of which 2.5% is frozen in the Antarctica,
          Arctic and glaciers. Humanity must therefore rely on 0.5 percent for all of man's ecosystem's and
          fresh water needs.</li>
          <li>Humankind is polluting water in rivers and lakes faster than nature can recycle and purify.</li>
          <li>More than 1 billion people still do not have access to fresh water.</li>
          <li>Excessive use of water contributes to the global water stress.</li>
          <li>Water is free from nature but the infrastructure needed to deliver it is expensive.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Energy</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>If people worldwide switched to energy efficient lightbulbs, the world would save US$120 billion
          dollar annually.</li>
          <li>Despite technological advances that have promoted energy efficiency gains, energy use in OECD countries
          will continue to grow another 35 percent by 2030. Commercial and residential energy use is the second
          most rapidly growing area of global energy use after transport.</li>
          <li>In 2002 the motor vehicle stock in OECD countries was 550 million vehicles (75 percent of which were
            personal cars). A 32 percent increase in vehicle ownership is expected by 2030. At the same time, motor vehicle
          kilometers are projected to increase by 40 percent and global air travel is projected to triple in the same period.</li>
          <li>Households consume 29 percent of global energy and consequently contribute to 21 percent of resultant CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</li>
          <li>The share of renewable energy in final energy consumption has reached 17.5% in 2015.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Food</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>While substantial environmental impacts from food occur in the production phase (agriculture, food processing), households
          influence these impacts through their dietary choices and habits. This consequently affects the environment through
          food-related energy consumption and waste generation.</li>
          <li>Each year, an estimated 1/3 of all food produced - equivalent to 1.3 billon tons worth around $1 trillion - ends
          up rotting in the bins of consumers and retailers, or spoiling due to poor transportation and harvesting practices.</li>
          <li>2 billion people globally are overweight or obese.</li>
          <li>Land degradation, declining soil fertility, unsustainable water use, overfishing and marine environment degradation
          are all lessening the ability of the natural resource base to supply food.</li>
          <li>The food sector accounts for around 30 percent of the world's total energy consumption and accounts for around 22
          percent of total greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>Goal Targets</h3>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>12.1 Implement the 10-year framework of programmes on sustainable consumption and production, all countries taking action,
          with developed countries taking the lead, taking into account the development and capabilities of developing countries.</li>
          <li>12.2 By 2030, achieve the sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources.</li>
          <li>12.3 By 2030, halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and reduce food losses along production
          and supply chains, including post-harvest losses.</li>
          <li>12.4 By 2020, achieve the environmentally sound management of chemicals and all wastes throughout their life cycle, in accordance
          with agreed international frameworks, and significantly reduce their release to air, water and soil in order to minimize their adverse
          impacts on human health and the environment.</li>
          <li>12.5 By 2030, substantially reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse.</li>
          <li>12.6 Encourage companies, especially large and transnational companies, to adopt sustainable practices and to integrate
          sustainability information into their reporting cycle.</li>
          <li>12.7 Promote public procurement practices that are sustainable, in accordance with national policies and priorities.</li>
          <li>12.8 By 2030, ensure that people everywhere have relevant information and awareness for sustainable development
          and lifestyles in harmony with nature.</li>
          <li>12.A Support developing countries to strengthen their scientific and technological capacity to move towards more sustainable
          patterns of consumption and production.</li>
          <li>12.B Develop and implement tools to monitor sustainable development impacts for sustainable tourism that creates jobs and promotes
          local culture and products.</li>
          <li>12.C Rationalize inefficient fossil-fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption by removing market distortions, in accordance
          with national circumstances, including by restructuring taxation and phasing out those harmful subsidies, where they exist, to reflect
          their environmental impacts, taking fully into account the specific needs and conditions of developing countries and minimizing the possible
          adverse impacts on their development in a manner that protects the poor and the affected communities.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
      <p>
        Economic and social progress over the last century has been accompanied by environmental degradation that is endangering the very systems on
        which our future development and very survival depend.
        If we don't act to change our consumption and production patterns, we will cause irreversible damage to our environment.
        Responsible production and consumption.
      </p>
      <h3>What can you do to help?</h3>
      <h4>As a Business</h4>
      <p>
        It's in businesses' interest to find new solutions that enable sustainable consumption and production patterns.
        A better understanding of environmental and social impacts of products and services is needed, both of product life cycles
        and how these are affected by use within lifestyles.
        Identifying "hot spots" within the value chain where interventions have the greatest potential to improve the environmental
        and social impact of the system as a whole is a crucial first step.
        Businesses can also use their innovative power to design solutions that can both enable and inspire individuals to lead more
        sustainable lifestyles, reducing impacts and improving well-being.
      </p>
      <h4>As a Consumer</h4>
      <p>
        There are two main ways to help: 1. Reducing your waste and 2. Being thoughtful about what you buy and choosing a sustainable option
        whenever possible. Reducing our waste can be done in many ways, from ensuring you don't throw away food to reducing your consumption of plastic -
        one of the main pollutants of the ocean. Carrying a reusable bag, refusing to use plastic straws, and recycling plastic bottles are good ways
        to do your part every day.
        Making informed purchases about what we're buying also helps. For example, the textile industry today is the second largest polluter of clean water
        after agriculture, and many fashion companies exploit textile workers in the developing world. If you can buy from sustainable and local sources
        you can make a difference as well as exercising pressure on businesses to adopt sustainable practices.

      <p class="goalTag">
        Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no country that is not experiencing the drastic effects of climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions are more than 50 percent higher than in 1990.
        Global warming is causing long-lasting changes to our climate system, which threatens irreversible consequences if we do not act.
        The annual average economic losses from climate-related disaster are in the hundreds of billion of dollars. This is not to mention the human impact of geo-physical
        disasters, which are 91 percent climate-related, and which between 1998 and 2017 killed 1.3 million people, and left 4.4 billion injured. The goal aims to mobilize US$100 billion
        annually by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries to both adapt to climate change and invest in low-carbon development.
        Supporting vulnerable regions will directly contribute not only to Goal 13 but also to the other SDGs. These actions must also go hand in hand with efforts to integrate disaster risk
        measures, sustainable natural resource management, and human security into national development strategies. It is still possible, with strong political will, increased investment, and using
        existing technology, to limit the increase in global mean temperature to two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, aiming at 1.5 degrees Celsius, but this requires urgent and
        ambitious collective action.

        <ul>
          <li>As of April 2018, 175 parties had ratified the Paris Agreement and 168 parties had communicated their first nationally determined contributions to the UN framework convention

        <h4>Thanks to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change we know</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>From 1880 to 2012, average global temperature increased by 0.85 degrees Celsius. To put this into perspective, for each 1 degree of temperature increase, grain
          yields decline by about 5 percent. Maize, wheat and other major crops have experienced significant yield reductions at the global level of 40 megatons per year between
          1981 and 2002 due to warmer climate.</li>
          <li>Oceans have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished and sea level has risen. From 1901 to 2010, the global average sea level rose by 19 cm as oceans
          expanded due to warming and ice melted. The Arctic's sea ice extent has shrunk in every successive decade since 1979, with 1.07 million km<super>2</super> of ice
          loss every decade.</li>
          <li>Given current concentrations and on-going emissions of greenhouse gases, it is likely that by the end of this century, the increase in global temperature
          will exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to 1850 to 1900 for all but one scenario. The world's oceans will warm and ice melt will continue. Average sea level rise is
          predicted as 24-30 cm by 2065 and 40-63 cm by 2100. Most aspects of climate change will persist for many centuries even if emissions are stopped.</li>
          <li>Global emissions of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) have increased by almost 50 percent since 1990.</li>
          <li>Emissions grew more quickly between 2000 and 2010 than in each of the three previous decades.</li>
          <li>It is still possible, using a wide array of technological measures and changes in behavior, to limit the increase in global mean temperature to two degrees
          Celsius above pre-industrial levels.</li>

      <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
      <p>
        As greenhouse gas levels continue to climb, climate change is occuring at much higher rates than anticipated, and its effects are evident worldwide. By addressing
        climate change, we can build a sustainable world for everyone. But we need to act now.
        Severe weather and rising sea levels are affecting people and their property in developed and developing countries. From a small farmer in the Philippines to a businessman
        in London, climate change is affecting everything, especially the poor and vulnerable, as well as marginalized groups like women, children and the elderly.
        Climate change is a global challenge that affects everyone, everywhere.
      </p>
      <h3>What can you do to help?</h3>
      <p>
        <h4>Food</h4>
        What we eat has major implications for climate change. The destruction of rainforests to create land for agriculture, along with growing demand for meat, are major
        contributors to the increasing greenhouse gases which are taking a significant toll on climate and global food security. To top it off, we waste about one-third of
        the food that is produced. But more people are taking a closer look at what they are eating and the impacts of their diets on their health and environment. More and
        more chefs and other food suppliers are focusing on local and organic produce and shifting away from meat-heavy meals and fast food. They are joined by a growing
        movement of people changing the way they cook and eat.
        <p>
          Your Challenge!
          Cook up dishes that are not only delicious but also god for the planet and good for us - reducing meat and emphasizing diverse vegetarian
          ingredients instead.
        </p>
        <h4>Fashion</h4>
        Making clothes has a huge impact on climate change. The textile industry contributes around ten percent of global greenhouse gas emissions - it uses more energy
        than the aviation and shipping industry combined, according to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The industry's impact
        is not limited to global carbon emissions. It also produces about 20 percent of global waste water and 85 percent of textiles end up in landfills or are
        incinerated when most of these materials could be reused.
        <p>
          Your Challenge!
          Upcycle your old clothes for new looks and share your creations on social media using.

        marine resources for sustainable development.
      </p>
      <p>
        The world's oceans - their temperature, chemistry, currents and life - drive global systems that make
        the Earth habitable for humankind. How we manage this vital resource is essential for humanity as a whole,
        and to counterbalance the effects of climate change.
        Over three billion people depend on marine and coastal biodiversity for their livelihoods. However, today we are
        seeing 30 percent of the world's fish stocks overexploited, reaching below the level at which they can produce
        sustainable yields.
        Oceans also absorb about 30 percent of the carbon dioxide produced by humans, and we are seeing a 26 percent
        rise in ocean acidification since the beginning of the industrial revolution. Marine pollution, an overwhelming
        majority of which comes from land-based sources, is reaching alarming levels, with an average of 13,000 pieces of
        plastic litter to be found on every square kilometre of ocean.
        The SGDs aim to sustainably manage and protect marine coastal and ecosystems from pollution, as well as address
        the impacts of ocean acidification. Enhancing conservation and the sustainable use of ocean-based resources
        through international law will also helo mitigate some of the challenges facing our oceans.

          <li>14.5 By 2020, conserve at least 10 percent of coastal and marine areas consistent with national and international law and
          based on the best available scientific information.</li>
          <li>14.6 By 2020, prohibit certain forms of fisheries subsidies which contribute to overcapacity and overfishing, eliminate subsidies
          that contribute to illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and refrain from introducing new such subsidies, recognizing that
          appropriate and effective special and differential treatment for developing and least developed countries should be an integral part
          of the World Trade Organization fisheries subsidies negotiation.</li>
          <li>14.7 By 2030, increase the economic benefits to Small Island developing States and least developed countries from the sustainable
          use of marine resources, including through sustainable management of fisheries, aquaculture and tourism.</li>

          Oceanographic Commission Criteria and Guidelines on the Transfer of Marine Technology, in order to improve ocean health and to enhance the
          contribution of marine biodiversity to the development of developing countries, in particular small island developing States and least
          developed countries.</li>
          <li>14.B Provide access for small-scale artisanal fishers to marine resources and markets.</li>
          <li>14.C Enhance the conservation and sustainable use of oceans and their resources by implementing international law as reflected in UNCLOS,

          of The Future We Want.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
      <p>
        Oceans provide key natural resources including food, medicines, biofules and other products. They help with the breakdown and removal of waste
        and pollution, and their ecosystems act sa buffers to reduce damage from storms. Maintaining healthy oceans supports climate change mitigation and
        adaptation efforts. And have you been to the seaside? It's also a great place for tourism and recreation.
        Even more, Marine Protected Areas contribute to poverty reduction by increasing fish catches and income, and improving health. They also help improve
        gender equality, as women do much of the work at small-scale fisheries.
        The marine environment is also home to a stunning variety of beautiful creatures, ranging from single-celled organisms to the biggest animal ever to
        have lived on the Earth - the blue whale. They are also home to coral reefs, one of the most diverse ecosystems on the planet.
        Careful management of this essential global resource is a key feature
        of a sustainable future.
      </p>
      <h3>What can you do to help?</h3>
      <p>
        For open ocean and deep sea areas, sustainability can be achieved only through increased international cooperation to protect vulnerable habitats.
        Establishing comprehensive, effective and equitably managed systems of government-protected areas should be pursued to conserve biodiversity and
        ensure a sustainable future for the fishing industry.
        On a local level, we should make ocean-friendly choices when buying products or eating food derived from oceans and consume only what we need.
        Selecting certified products is a good place to start.
        Making small changes in our daily lives, like taking public transport and unplugging electronics save energy. These actions reduce our carbon footprint,
        a factor that contributes to rising sea levels.
        We should eliminate plastic usage as much as possible and organize beach clean-ups.
        Most importantly, we can spread the message about how important marine life is and why we need to protect it.

      <h2 id="goals15">Goal 15 - Life on Land</h2>
      <p class="goalTag">
        Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems,
        sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and
        halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss.
      </p>
      <p>
        Human life depends on the earth as much as the ocean for our sustenance and livelihoods. Plant life provides 80 percent of the human diet, and we rely on agriculture
        as an important economic resources. Forests cover 30 percent of the Earth's surface, provide vital habitats for millions of species, and important sources for clean air
        and water, as well as being crucial for combating climate change.
        Every year, 13 million hectares of forests are lost, while the persistent degradation of drylands has led to the desertification of 3.6 billion hectares, disproportionately
        affecting poor communities.
        While 15 percent of land is protected, biodiversity is still at risk. Nearly 7,000 species of animals and plants have been illegally traded. Wildlife trafficking not only erodes
        biodiversity, but creates insecurity, fuels conflict, and feeds corruption.
        Urgent action must be taken to reduce the loss of natural habitats and biodiversity which are part of our common heritage and support global food and water security, climate change
        mitigation and adaptation, and peace and security.
      </p>
      <h3>Facts and Figures</h3>
      <p>
        <h4>Forests</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Around 1.6 billion people depend on forests for their livelihood, including 70 million indigenous people.</li>
          <li>Forests are home to more than 80 percent of all terrestrial species of animals, plants and insects.</li>
          <li>Between 2010 and 2015, the world lost 3.3 million hectares of forest areas. Poor rural women depend on common pool resources and are especially affected by their depletion.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Desertification</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>2.6 billion people depend directly on agriculture, but 52 percent of the land used for agriculture is moderately or severely affected by soil degradation.</li>
          <li>Arable land loss is estimated at 30 and 35 times the historical rate.</li>
          <li>Due to drought and desertification, 12 million hectares are lost each year (23 hectares per minute). Within one year, 20 million tons of grain could have been grown.</li>
          <li>74 percent of the poor are directly affected by land degradation globally.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Biodiversity</h4>

          <li>Fish provide 20 percent of animal protein to about 3 billion people. Only ten species provide about 30 percent of marine capture fisheries and ten species provide about 50
          percent of aquaculture production.</li>
          <li>Over 80 percent of the human diet is provided by plants. Only three cereal crops - rice, maize and wheat - provide 60 percent of energy intake.</li>
          <li>As many as 80 percent of people living in rural areas in developing countries based medicines for basic healthcare.</li>
          <li>Micro-organisms and invertebrates are key to ecosystem services, but their contributions are still poorly known and rarely acknowledged.</li>

      <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
      <p>
        Forests cover nearly 31 percent of our planet's land area. From the air we breathe, to the water we drink, to the food we eat - forests sustain us.
        Around 1.6 billion people depend on forests for their livelihood. Almost 75 percent of the world's poor are affected directly by land degradation.
        Forests are home to more than 80 percent of all terrestrial species of animals, plants and insects. However, biodiversity is declining faster than any other time in human history. An estimated
        20 percent of the Earth's land area was degraded between 2000 and 2015.
        Biodiversity and the ecosystem services it underpins can also be the basis for climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction strategies as they can deliver benefits that will increase
        the resilience of people to the impacts of climate change.
        Forests and nature are also important for recreation and mental well-being. In many cultures, natural landscapes are closely linked to spiritual values, religious belifs and traditional
        teachings.
        Sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, halt and reverse
        land degradation, halt biodiversity loss.
      </p>
      <h3>What can you do to help?</h3>
      <p>
        Inevitably, we change the ecosystems we are a part of through our presence - but we can make choices that either affirm diversity or devalue it.
        Some things we can do to help include recycling, eating a locally-based diet that is sustainably sourced, consuming only what we need, and limiting energy usage through efficient heating and cooling systems. We
        must also be respectful toward wildlife and only take part in ecotourism opportunities that are responsibly and ethically run in order to prevent wildlife disturbance. Well-managed protected areas support healthy
        ecosystems, which in turn keep people healthy. It is therefore critical to secure the involvement of the local communities in the development and management of these protected areas.

        Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development,
        provide access to justice for all and build effective,
        accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels.
      </p>
      <p>
        We cannot hope for sustainable development without peace, stability, human rights and effective governance, based on the rule of law. Yet our world is increasingly divided. Some regions
        enojoy peace, security and prosperity, while others fall into seemingly endless cycles of conflict and violence. This is not inevitable and must be addressed.
        Armed violence and insecurity have a destructive impact on a country's development, affecting economic growth, and often resulting in grievances that last for generations. Sexual violence, crime,
        exploitation and torture are also prevalent where there is conflict, or no rule of law, and countries must take measures to protect those who are most at risk.
        The SDGs aim to significantly reduce all forms of violence, and work with governments and communities to end conflict and insecurity. Promoting the rule of law and human rights are key to this
        process, as is reducing the flow of illicit arms and strengthening the participation of developing countries in the institutions of global governance.

      The SDGs can only be realized with strong global partnership and cooperation. Official Development Assistance remained steady but below target, at US $147 billion in 2017. While humanitarian
      crises brought on by conflict or natural disasters continue to demand more financial resources and aid. Many countries also require Official Development Assistance to encourage
      growth and trade.
      The world is more internconnected than ever. Improving access technology and knowledge is an important way to share ideas and foster innovation. Coordinating policies
      to help developing countries manage their debt, as well as promoting investment for the least developed, is vital for sustainable growth and
      development.
      The goals aim to enhance North-South and South-South cooperation by supporting national plans to achieve all the targets. Promoting international trade, and helping
      developing countries increase their exports is all part of achieving a universal rules-based and equitable trading system that is fair and open and benefits all.

    <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
    <p>
      We are all in this together. The Agenda, with its 17 Sustainable Development Goals, is universal and calls for action by all countries, both developed countries and developing countries, to ensure
      no one is left behind.
      In 2015, world leaders adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development that aims to end poverty, tackle inequalities and combat climate change. We need everyone to come together - governments,
      civil society, academia and the private sector - to achieve the sustainable development goals.
      Revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development.
