    <h1>A Choice</h1>
    <p>
      After school, you and Callan leave the huge horde of boys returning home their respective village. You grab his arm and pull him away from the main
      road. He follows you for a short bit, before he stops and archs an eyebrow at you.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When are you going to tell me what we're doing, man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We're having an adventure." you grin at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's Friday, several hours until the sun goes down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What kind of adventure?" he looks suspiciously at you.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't worry so much Callan." you reassure him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come on, man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We're celebrating your birthday." you grin at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His birthday was a couple of days ago, and you haven't done anything together for it yet.
      He stares at you.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We're going into the city!" you exclaim excitedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He's still staring at you, looking dead serious.
      You're starting to feel less sure that this was a great idea.
      Callan is looking at you, and your grin fades and you're feeling like maybe you made a mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Man, why would I want to do that?" Callan says sounding bored and annoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      You open your mouth to reply, but don't know what to say so close your mouth, and open it again to speak.
      You don't get any sound out, you end up gaping like a goldfish.
      The corners of Callan's mouth are twitching and he bursts out laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Man, if you could see your face." he laughs and points at your face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bastard tricked you, making you feel like he didn't want to do anything special with you. You're only angry for a moment though, before you
      are laughing along with Callan.
    </p>
    <p>
      You make your way to the city by bus, you've only been here a couple of times with your father. The buses are always extremely crowded, and hot - today is
      no exception.
      The sky has started to darken, the city skyline is visible several
      miles away. As the bus approaches the bus stop, you watch the bustling city - the streets are filled with hawkers and costermongers, and potential buyers.
      As soon as you step of the bus, the smells hits you, making your nostrils flare. The air is filled with a combination of sweet spices and exhaust from vehicles.
      There are unpleasant smells as well, the kind that's produced when a lot of people are in a very confined area - sweat, garbage, excrement, and urine.
      The sun is setting, but you can still see the ground radiating the heat it soaked up during the day. The bus didn't have any aircondition, they rarely do, so
      you actually feel relieved stepping off the bus, and being able to breathe in air that doesn't come from another person's mouth.
      You turn around to face Callan, who has a huge grin on his face, it's the first time he's in the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What should we do first??" he exclaims, looking eagerly at you.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know, it's your birthday." you grin at him, enjoying his giddiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to go have a drink." he states.
    </p>
    <p>
      You grin at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure, man."
    </p>
    <p>
      You lead Callan down a street, bars and more shady drinking holes along the sides. You're letting him choose which one that you'll go to.
      Callan is giddy with excitement, he's popping his head into every other place that you're passing, checking them out.
      Finally, he stops in front of a shady, worn-down looking bar. You look at him curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why did you choose this place?" you wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know. I like it." Callan shrugs his shoulder, and walks into the bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's pretty dark, you have to squint your eyes to make out the inside of the bar. It's modest sized and worn out, the paint seems to be missing
      at more places than not.
      As there is no age limit for alcohol in this area, you walk straight up to the bar.
      The bartender looks up at you as you approaches. The bartender is a middle-aged man, he is short and stout, the hair around his temples have
      a hint of gray in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What can I get ya?" he drawls at you.
    </p>
    <p>
      You've never had alcohol before, but you know Callan frequently visits bars, so you glance at him through the corner of your eye - silently
      begging him to order for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two Palm Wines." Callan says without hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      You sit down at the bar, you scan the rest of the patrons. There are a handful of men that looks to be in their thirties.
      Callan elbows you and you grunt. You rub your ribs and turn to glare at him.
      He rolls his eyes at you before he nods towards the front of the bar.
      In
       the corner, you see three girls, in their late teens. You must have missed them when you entered, because you have no idea how you haven't seen them before.
      They're all beautiful in their own distinguishable way. However, you're drawn more to one than the rest. You can't help looking at her, she's wearing a yellow
      dress with white dots. Her hair is in long braids down her back.
      The bartender returns with your drinks, and you pay. Callan grabs his drinks and slides off his bar stool, you follow his lead.
      Callan makes his way over to the girls. You're feeling nervous, you can feel the palms of your hands starting to get clammy. You're not used to talk to
      pretty girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hello ladies," Callan smiles widely at the girls, "can my brother and I, join you?".
    </p>
    <p>
      He cocks his head and looks innocently at them. The girls look at him and
      giggles. Jealousy hits you, Callan is very tall and muscular, and girls have called him handsome for years. You've never turned heads the way he does.
      And now, you're standing in front of three beautiful girls, and nobody is noticing you. A hard knot is building up in your stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We could use some company." the girl in the yellow dress says, smiling back at Callan.
    </p>
    <p>
      You pull up chairs and sit down with the girls - whose names you learn are Amara, Nala, and Zuri.
    </p>
    <p>
      You blink, you don't know how much you've been drinking, but your vision is blurry. No matter how much you blink, you can't get your vision to clear.
      You throw a glance outside and it's completely dark. The bar is almost empty now, there are a couple middle-aged men up near the bar, who seem to be
      more drunk than you are. There are two men in their twenties, sitting in a booth talking quietly. Two old men in a booth playing chess. And then you,
      Callan, and the three girls. One of the girls, Nala (you think?), glances at her watch, before speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Girls, we should get going." one of the other girl nods in agreement and starts standing up to grab her purse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh come on, don't leave us now!" Callan whines at them, "We've barely got to know each other!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Two of the girls are already standing up, while the girl in the yellow dress is still sitting down.
      She turns her head to her friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do we have to leave already?" she blinks innocently at her friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Amara. We need to go home." Nala says.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amara leans over to Callan, and whispers something in his ear, throwing them both into a fit of giggles. She sits up straight, and looks at her friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to stay." she says in a determined tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, Amara. You know we should go home together." Zuri says.
    </p>
    <p>
      This makes Callan cock his head up straight, and look more serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can walk her home later, if you're concerned." he offers, with a wink towards Amara.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes! My hero!" Amara exclaims excitedly, and gives him a kiss on his cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her friends, however, don't seem to like this idea. They try to convince her to leave with them, but Amara has made up her mind, she isn't leaving.
      Zuri and Nala, both look extremely worried about leaving their friend behind.
      Eventually, they give up and leave Amara with you and Callan, they throw worried looks over their shoulders when they exit, but Amara is waving
      happily at them.
    <p>
      Callan is getting you a few more drinks, and you have a moment on your own with Amara. She is really intelligent, funny, and beautiful. You feel shy around her,
      you don't know how to act around her. Your voice isn't working with you, you keep stuttering. She smells of fresh roses, you can't stop breathing her in.
      Callan comes back, sits down swiftly and hands Amara another drink. She giggles and thanks him. You know that she barely notices you, and has all her attention
      on Callan. You sigh, and get on your feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where are you going?" Callan looks up at you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amara doesn't take her eyes of Callan, which gives you a hard knot in your stomach. Making you feel invisible. You don't want to be a third wheel anymore.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm gonna play some dart, man."
    </p>
    <p>
      Callan nods at you.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have fun."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I'm sure I will." he grins at you.
    </p>
    </p>
    <p>
      Much later, you don't know exactly how much later, but you're even more drunk. You didn't think that was possible, but you feel nauseous
      and your entire world is spinning. And not just because you've been playing this damn cheating pinball machine - it's impossible to win on this thing.
      You realize you have to piss, you stumble towards the bathroom - there is only one. And of course, it's occupied.
      You really, really have to piss. You find a door leading to the alley outside. The handle is hard, almost like it's jammed from the outside, but you feel silly
      for even thinking that. With brute force, you manage to get the door open, and you almost fall out. You stumble a few steps before regaining your balance.
      That's when you hear it - a whimpering sound, somewhere behind you.
      In your drunken haze it takes you a few moments to locate the sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      You turn around and the first thing that hits you, is the smell. The smell of vomit and blood. It's making you gag, and you put your arm in front of you, to
      prevent the smell from hitting your nostrils full on. The sight in front of you is terrifying, time seems to slow down, and you see everything in slow motion.
      Amara is laying on her stomach on a wooden box. Her yellow dress is bloody and ripped to pieces. Her long legs are covered with blood and excrete. Above her, stands
      Callan, he's pulling up his pants.
      Amara lifts her head and turns towards you, when you see her face you can't help but let out a gasp. Her face is swollen - blue and bloody, she also has
      puke on her face. You can barely
      recognize her beautiful face. Her long hair is disheveled, and parts of it has been ripped off and is laying on the ground.
      Your gasp alerts Callan that there is somebody else there, he tenses up and swirls around. You can see him relaxing at the sight of you.
    </p>
    <p>
      "James! What are you doing out here?" he smiles at you, ignoring Amara.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I..." you clear your throat, "I have to piss."
    </p>
    <p>
      Your eyes are darting between Callan and Amara. She's quietly crying behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you waiting for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Uhm, I went. Inside."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, okay. We should probably go home." he scratches his left hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can see his bruised knuckles, after connecting with Amara's face. You take a step closer to Callan, he cocks his eyebrows at you.
    </p>
    <p>
    "Why did you do this?" you ask him quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?" he says looking confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      You nod towards Amara.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What? Her?" Callan laughs.
    </p>
    <p>
      You nod in a silent respons.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She was asking for it." he tells you.
    </p>
    <p>
      You don't know if you believe him, but he is your best friend. Your best friend who has always been extremely kind to you, your mother, and your sisters.
      You would never have believed that he was capable of hurting anybody at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come on" he says cheerfully and moves past you. You're frozen, you can't move. Callan turns back to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      "James, let's go." he stares intently at you.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are still not moving. You're looking towards Amara. Callan steps into your view, blocking her out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen." he says, and pokes a finger at your chest, "You don't tell anybody about this."
    </p>
    <p>
      You meet his gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't tell your mother, your sisters, your father, my mother, or my father." he says with a stone cold voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Callan grabs your arm and drag you away, you throw a look at Amara over your shoulder. You meet her eyes, but not really, her
      gaze just passes through you. You follow Callan into the hot bar again, but he doesn't stop, he pulls you with him out the front.
      The cool night air hits you. He lets go of your arm, you stumble and fall to the ground.
      Your head is swirling with what just happened. You can't believe that it did. You are aware that you don't know the full story, but
      no matter what the story is, this shouldn't be the ending.
      You are standing on all fours, gasping for breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get yourself together" Callan grabs your shoulders and yanks you to your feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      You manage to stand up, but your head is still spinning. You take a deep breath, and slowly exhale. Then another.
      Your world is no longer spinning, but you're still having a hard time grasping what you saw. You aren't naive, you know exactly
      what happened. You know what Callan did. And that it was wrong. You lift your head and further down the street, you see two police
      officers patrolling the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      You look at the officers, and then at Callan, who seems to understand what you're thinking. He gives you a warning look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't forget that I only did that cause I'm drunk." he hisses at you, "And, I was only drinking cause you brought me here."
    </p>
    <p>
      You bite your lip and consider your options. You can get the attention of the officers, or you can let it go.
