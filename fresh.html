    <h1>A New Start</h1>
    <p>
      You moved your entire family to Canada, for a new start. It went smoother than expected, you quickly got a new job as an electrical engineer.
      All of your children settled into the new house and country fairly quickly. Kyan was absolutely glowing of happiness. After a while, he
      had come out to the rest of his family, and they all supported him. They also saw the move with new eyes, now when they knew the reason behind it.
      Neela was also happier, knowing why you had moved them all away from everything that was known to the family. She was happy that you chose to
      protect your family, and you two decided to try and start over and put everything in the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neela got pregnant again, and you found out it's a boy. You're really happy that everything worked out. You, and the rest of your family,
      do miss your relatives though. You know that you can never go back, both your relatives, and Neela's, were extremely mad about your decision
      to move to Canada. You received threats from both sides of the family. This is something that always weights heavily in your heart, the way
      things turned out with your extended family. But the most important thing is that you and your family are happy and safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kyan came out openly as gay, and his new friends all accepted him and supported him. You couldn't be more proud over your little boy.
