    <h1>A Dream</h1>
    <p>
      You have managed to sneak out to school for a while, not without suspicion, but you've
      never been caught. One day when you come home from school, you find your mother crying outside while working in the yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ma, what's wrong?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your father came to get Clara" your mother sobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father? Why would he do that?" you're shocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's negotiated a marriage for her."
    </p>
    <p>
      You are frozen to the ground and you don't know what to say, so you go to your special place - an abandoned barn in the outskirt of the village. Once there
      you let your sobs out. Your oldest sister is gone, and you didn't have a chance to say goodbye. You've always known this is what you and your sisters
      were raised for.
      Good African girls are supposed to be seen but not heard, and the entire village will help mothers raise their children. The girls are to learn how
      to become a good wife. You know this, but you never thought that it would happen to your family.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have been going to school for years now, and you're a great student. You love learning, and you take everything that Mr. Ward teach
      you to heart. Your dream is to earn a scholarship and be allowed to go to a university in the capital. You're hoping that if you earn a scholarship,
      that you can tell your mother, and she will agree that an education is the most important thing for you and let you go. However, you dread that
      you will be forced into an arranged marriage, just like your sisters have been.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time ever, you have a hard time concentrating on Mr. Ward. Your 16th birthday is coming up in less than a month, and you wonder when
      your father is going to come for you. He has came for your sisters after their 16th birthdays, but before they turned 17.
      Maybe you can run away? Perhaps you're able to move to university before you get married off. You chew your upper lip thinking, will you be able to
      pretend to be a boy throughout the entire university? Are you going to have to pretend to be a boy for the rest of your life?
    </p>
    <p>
      You notice a shadow hovering over you. You look up at Mr. Ward frowning at you.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Darren."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry, Mr. Ward" you apologize.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Darren, in my office after class." Mr. Ward says in a stern tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir." you acknowledge in a weak voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      You do your best to pay attention for the rest of class, but your mind keeps wandering.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the class you put your things away in your bench, then stand up on weak legs and look over at Mr. Ward who has gotten hold up with a few students
      asking him questions. Mr. Ward meets your gaze and motion with his hand for you to enter his office and wait for him there.
      You walk over to his office and open the door and enter. You've never been in his office before, your jaw drops as you look around.
      Three walls are covered with books on shelves, and against the fourth wall, under the window, is a large wooden desk.
      You've never seen so many books in your entire life, and you had no idea Mr. Ward had a library in his office!
      Mr. Ward enters his office and go sit down behind his desk, he motions for you to sit down.
      Mr. Ward looks you intently in your eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Darren, what I am about to tell you now..." he begins.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know why you did it, but I want you to know that I've known from the first day, and I have never cared." you can't move or breethe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know that you're a girl, and I have never treated you differently than the boys." you're frozen, you feel your cheeks turn red, and your jaw falls open.
    </p>
    <p>
      You draw a breathe to speak, but Mr. Ward holds up his hand to stop you.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've been one of my best students, ever. I don't know what has you troubled right now, and you don't have to tell me if you don't want to." he takes a deep breathe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I want you to know that you can talk to me." he looks at you with his kind, intelligent eyes, that seem to bare your soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      You sit silent, under his gaze for a few minutes. You're considering his offer to talk. You chew your lower lip. Mr. Ward sits patiently
      waiting for you to come to a conclusion.
      You look down onto the floor, twisting your hands around in your lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe, you can tell me your name?" he says kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's..." you clear your throat, "it's Rosie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a pretty name."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You really knew?" you say with disbelief.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      You dare peaking up at him, and he's smiling warmly at you. His office chair creaks as he leans back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rosie, I came to this country to help children get a better education and a better future." he cocks an eyebrow, "I know that girls
      have it rough here."
    </p>
    <p>
      You slowly nod.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My...my father will come for me soon, to marry me off. Within a year. To a man I don't know, and won't meet before the wedding"
      you saw slowly, watching for his reaction.
    </p>
    <p>
       You're expecting him to
      tell you that you should listen to your father, but instead he gets a look of disgust on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a barbaric practice" he snarls.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want to, I want to go to university." you blurt out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You should." he nods, "You're a very intelligent young woman, and you have the whole world at your feet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "However" he takes a deep breathe, "if that is the route you take, it won't be easy. And you'd probably have to leave your family behind."
    </p>
    <p>
      You feel powerless, you feel like you have no say about anything at all. You feel helpless, you feel rage, you feel sadness.
      A single tear is forming, blurring your vision. You try to blink it away, but it's only making it worse. Before you know it, you're crying,
      sobbing and shaking. Mr. Ward gets up from his chair, and comes around his desk to comfort you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later that night, when you're lying in bed, you can't help but feeling torn. You never thought that your dreams could come true, but maybe they can?
      Maybe you don't have to do what your father orders you, maybe you can create your own destiny. Your own fate, your own happy ending. After tossing and
      turning for hours, you fall into a restless sleep.
