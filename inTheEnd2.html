    <h1>In the End</h1>
    <p>
      A sharp pain radiates through your abdomen. At the same moment thunder rumbles and rolls over the sky. Seconds later, the darkness is vanquished
      momentarily by lightning. As the pain subsides, the sparks from the flash are still dancing in front of your eyes. You blink to get them away.
      Your room is pitch black. There is no moon tonight, no extra light guiding you.
    </p>
    <p>
      A lightning flash lights up the room, accompanied with another sharp pain in your abdomen. A groan escapes your lips. Your groan grows louder with the increased
      pain, until you're screaming straight out into the dark room. The pain vanishes and your scream dies. The room is so silent, you can hear the insects outside the
      open window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laying here, in the dark, all alone - your thoughts go to your mother. Your dear mother, who passed away a year ago. A tear rolls down your cheek. Your mother
      was killed in a burglary. Without any man there to protect her, she'd been robbed and raped before being murdered. The perpetrators were never caught, and never
      will be. You miss your mother, and you wish that she was by your side at this moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      After you got married to Jamir, you got to stay in his house in the city. You've been taking care of the house - cooking, cleaning, washing, and the grocery shopping.
      You weren't allowed to leave the house, unless it was for domestic errands. You spend the rest of the days, cleaning the house. You are mostly bored. You are not
      allowed to speak to any neighbors. And you are definately not allowed to talk to any men at all. You tried to kill the boredom by reading. You were reading about
      adventures and fairytales, and dreaming yourself away from this life.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the nigths Jamir wanted to have sex with you, no matter how you felt about it.
      It was his marital right after all, and he would hit you if you didn't do what he wanted, so it was easier to just give in. You did long for something loving though.
      You never enjoyed being intimate with Jamir, and you always did your best to get him off as soon as possible, to get it all over with. After he finish, he always
      roll over and immediately starts snoring. As soon as possible, you go to the bathroom and shower, you want to wash of his skin and scent from your body. You scrub
      thoroughly, it never help to make you feel better, no matter how much you scrub.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, two years into your marriage. You're laying here alone, missing your mother, in the dark. Another sharp pain spreads through your body, this one is the worst yet.
      Your body is completely covered in a a layer of sweat. You let out another guttural scream. You are scared, you wonder if this is how your mother felt during her
      first pregnancy. There is a hospital in the city, but Jamir says it's too expensive and that women have given birth without a doctor for centuries.
      And if they have been able to do it, then she can do it too. That's why she's laying here, without any help, trying to give birth to her first baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      You feel extremely tired, and you wonder how this is possible? How are you going to give birth to your baby on your own? You wish you had been allowed to see a doctor,
      or at least a midwife. The pain is constant now, and there isn't any other option than to keep pushing. The pain is so bad that you're almost passing out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, the door swings open. In comes a woman, wearing a hooded cloak. You look up at her from the bed. She lowers her hood and meets your eyes, it is Zora,
      Jamir's first wife. The first time you two met, she looked at you with disgust. However, you don't blame her, before you married Jamir, she was the one living
      comfortably in the city. Jamir moved her to a hut in a village not far from the city. Forcing her to live a much harder life, without any protection. Now,
      she's standing in your room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wh..." your voice breaks, "What are you doing here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Helping you." she says.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jamir told me you were due." she kneels next to your bed, "And I know you don't have anybody to help you."
    </p>
    <p>
      You grab her hand and squeeze it hard, look into her eyes and whisper:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, Zora."
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiles softly at you in response, and removes her cloak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll be right back." she says.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pain shoots through your abdomen, and you think that you're going to die. You think about the baby, you know that Jamir wants a son. Zora has two children,
      both are girls. This must have been how your mother felt when she was giving birth to you, 17 years ago. You start to sob.
      Your poor mother who really needed to give birth to a daughter to stay in your father's grace. Zora was the same, you know that you were a replacement for her.
      Zora was much older when she married, she couldn't have more children. The door opens and Zora comes back with towels and hot water.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought you hated me." you say weakly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zora stops what she's doing and turns around to look at you.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What makes you think that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The first time we met, you looked at me like you hated me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Zora frowns and approaches your bed. She lifts her hand and strokes your hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You couldn't be more wrong." she looks down at you.
    </p>
    <p>
      She takes a deep breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't hate you." she looks at you warmly, "I was pitying you."
    </p>
    <p>
      With those words you start to cry.
