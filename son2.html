    <h1>All Grown Up</h1>
    <p>
      You and your firstborn son have always been extremely close, you named him Kyan - meaning 'Little King'. From the moment you lay your eyes
      on your son, you've adored him every single moment. You've been more involved in his childhood, than other fathers. The other fathers at
      your company, barely see their children. You've helped out with Kyan - changing diapers, feeding him, and raising him in general.
      You and Neela have been blessed with four other children, three girls and one boy. You love every single one of your children, but there
      is something special about Kyan, you have an unique bond with each other. Neela has been fighting for letting the girls go to school,
      and you gave in because you were tired of hearing her nag. You received a huge sum of money a few years ago, when your paternal grandfather
      passed away. You used some of these money to buy a new house, and send your sons to an extremely good and reputable private school.
      Your girls are going to a public school, which has always caused an issue in your marriage. However, you don't see any point in spending
      money sending the girls to a private school when they are never going to work.
    </p>
    <p>
      You're sitting on a bench on the front porch, waiting for your boys to come home for the summer after another school year. You're smoking a
      cigarette, and watching the sky. There are barely any clouds, and the sun is high, it's a beautiful day.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Your boys are running up to you. Taur, your youngest child runs up to you, he's grown while he was away. You scoop him up in your arms and give him
      a hug. Taur is only 7 years old, but he lives up to his name which means "Lion". He's already broad shouldered and tall enough to pass for a 13 year old.
      You set him down on the ground again, and he runs into the house to find his mother. You turn to Kyan who is standing grinning at you, you pull him
      into a tight hug.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I love you." you whisper to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I love you too, father."
    </p>
    <p>
      You grab his shoulders and look at him, he's grown since you last saw him. He's grown into a handsome young man, he turned 16 years old just a few days
      ago. His smile is warm, but it isn't quite reaching his eyes, they don't sparkle like they use to. You frown and sit down, while motion for him to sit down
      next to you. He joins you on the bench, for a moment you're both sitting there quiet, watching each other. You decide to break the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I love you, you know that right?" you look intensely into his eyes, "You can tell me anything."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's wrong, Kyan?" you're starting to get worried, "Is there something at school?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Kyan shakes his head, and bites his bottom lip. He looks at you, and you can see the internal battle through his eyes. He's fighting to decide if he should
      tell you or not. He closes his eyes for a minute. When he opens them again, there's a serenity in them. You can feel that he's made peace with whatever it
      is that he wants to tell you. He stares at the sky and opens his mouth to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father, I've realized something while I was away at school." he pauses and takes a deep breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it, son?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Kyan is still not looking at you, he has his gaze fixed on the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father, I..." he swallows hard, and tears stream down his cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      You reach out and wipe the tears away from his cheeks, you grab his head and turn his gaze towards you. He's looking into your eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am gay." he whispers, almost inaudible, but you heard him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your entire world is turned upside down. Your heart stops beating for a moment. You look at your boy, your handsome boy. You have always have many dreams
      for Kyan's future, this wasn't one that had ever crossed your mind. You know how hard it must have been for him to tell you, but you don't know what to say.
      Kyan gets up, and runs into the house. You are left alone, dumbfounded. You only ever wished for Kyan to be happy, being gay in Africa is not easy.
      It is not a lifestyle that is supported, and in many regions it's outright illegal. You and your entire family could be shunned if they found out about Kyan.
      Alternatively, Kyan could be forced to live an extremely hard life on his own, or a fake life where he has to pretend to be straight for the rest of his life.
