    <h1>Deny Kyan</h1>
    <p>
      In your region the penalty of homosexuality is lifetime in prison. Everybody around you will shun your family, if they find out about
      Kyan's sexuality. The worst part is that not even your closest relatives are going to accept it. You sigh heavily, you know it's really
      unfair of you to ask Kyan to suppress his sexuality, he will never find happiness that way. You love Kyan, you can't ask him to leave your
      family. There are only two options, and neither is your to make, you have to talk to Kyan.
    </p>
    <p>
      You knock on Kyan's door, he opens it slowly. You can tell he's been crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can I come in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He nods, and lets you in. He walks over and sits down on his bed. You sit down next to him, put your arm around his shoulders. You lean in
      and give him a kiss on his forehead. You take a deep breath before speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kyan, I love you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know it's illegal to be homosexual here, and I don't want you to spend the rest of your life in prison."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kyan is quietly sobbing against your chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can't stay here and live like 'that'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You either suppress your sexuality and stay here, or you have to leave the country. Go to Europe or North America."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't make this choice for you, it has to be your own."
    </p>
    <p>
      You hug Kyan one more time, before standing up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I love you, son. Always."
    </p>
    <p>
      With those words you walk out of Kyan's room. You can hear him crying. Tears are streaming down your own eyes too. You wish that there
      was another option. You can't uproot the entire family, and force them to leave everything behind.
