    <h1>Run Away</h1>
    <p>
      The three days are passing in a blur, you are torn about what to do. You love your family and you don't want to leave them and never see them again.
      However, you don't want to be forced to get married to a man that you've never met, and you most likely won't ever love that man.
      You know it's all a business transaction, your father will receive a decent sized dowry for you.
      You know that you're considered your father's possession and that he can do whatever he wants with you, and that you have no say in the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have decided to take control over your life and run away. You know it's going to be hard to never see your mother and sisters again, but you
      don't want this life. You want to do the things that you choose, and you have an extremely strong desire to see the world. It is your dream to
      travel around the world and see all that it has to offer.
      You want to attend university, and you want to help others get a better life too.
      You know far too many girls who have been born to basically become slaves to the man who can offer the most dowry for her.
      And you don't want to end up like one of those girls. You know that life isn't a fairytale, there is likely no Prince Charming coming
      to save you. Nor is it unlikely that there is such a thing as true love and soul mates. You aren't naive, you know that these things
      don't happen in real life. You know that these are all children's stories intended to give them hope, and not think that the world
      is as cruel and dark as it really is.
    </p>

    <p>
      You are also aware that your father doesn't see anything wrong with the way he's treating you. This behavior is deeply rooted in your culture.
      Women and girls are considered possessions, not allowed to inherit or have a say in their own lives. Basically, your meant to obey your father, until
      the day you marry, then you obey your husband. If there aren't any husband or father in the picture, you have to obey your brothers, or whoever is
      your closest male relative. You think that this practice is wrong, but there isn't anything that you can do about it right now, maybe in the future,
      you can return and somehow help other girls in the same situation as you currently are in.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the morning of the third day, you're kneeling by your mother's side when you hear a rustling behind you. You turn around and see David enter your
      home. You give him a nervous smile, and he looks at you seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you made up your mind?" he asks quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yeah, I want to leave."
    </p>
    <p>
      He nods slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have a plan." he says, "You can't leave before your father has come to fetch you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will follow you to the city, you'll have to find a way to sneak out of the house." he takes a deep breath, "Do you know anyone that would be willing to help?"
    </p>
    <p>
      You think long and hard, you've made a few really good friends in school, but they don't know that you're a girl. Then it hits you, school!
    </p>
    <p>
      "My teacher, Mr. Ward, he might help me." you tell David.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Great, I will take you there." David smiles at you, "Everything is gonna be alright, okay?"
    </p>
    <p>
      You throw your arms around his neck, and hugs him tightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you! Thank you so much for helping me." you whisper in his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a rustle behind you and your father walks in behind you, he sees the two of you embracing each other and you can tell that his
      temper is flaring. Before you can react, he takes a couple long strides up to you and grabs you by the scruff of your neck and pulls you away from David.
      He is lifting you up by your neck in the air, your wince from the pain. You feel like a kitten, dangling in the air like that.
      David stares defiantly at your father, but he doesn't do anything. You pray he won't do anything stupid. Your father lifts his open hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      *SMACK*
    </p>
    <p>
      He slaps you with his open hand, then drops you in a heap on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What the hell, do ya think you're doing?" he sneers at you.
    </p>
    <p>
      You rub your cheek, but don't say anything. Your father spits next to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whore." the words escapes your fathers lips, so quietly that you are not entirely sure you heard him correctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, you know with your entire soul that your father said what he did. You know that he doesn't have any respect for you.
      He doesn't love you, he doesn't care for you. All he sees is a commodity to be used.
    </p>
    <p>
      He grabs your arm hard, and yanks you to your feet. He drags you out to his truck and pushes you into the passenger seat. He slams
      the door behind you, walks over to the driver's side and gets in. You can feel his hand burning on your face.
      You see David running out to his father's old beaten car that he received as a present for being accepted to the university.
      Your father drives away, and the plan is in motion.
