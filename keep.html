    <h1>Keep Your Virginity</h1>
    <p>
      You decide that you can't sell yourself, the whole reason you ran away was to prevent your father from selling you.
      You try to find another way to get money to get out of the country, but nobody would hire you. You finally managed to trick a shopkeeper
      that you're a boy, and he hired you to be his new assistant. You sweep the floors, and dust the shelves. You make sure that the store
      is clean and respectable. The shopkeeper is a man in his late 20's, he's of average height, and slim. His name is Zane and he lives in an apartment above the
      store.
    </p>
    <p>
      You're still living with Banu, paying her rent. Banu never brings home 'customers' to her place, but sometimes they get rough with
      her, and you help patch her up. You keep telling her that it's not a life for her and that she's going to get seriously hurt sooner or
      later. Banu always rejects your fears as childish.
    </p>
    <p>
      You slowly but surely start saving up money for your ticket out of here. However, one day you get the message you feared, but hoped would never
      come - Banu was sexually assaulted by some guys and she was infected with HIV. You cried with your friend, your only friend in this world.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is a medicine that can slow down the progress." Banu says in-between tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you get it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Banu shakes her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's too expensive."
    </p>
    <p>
      You hug your best friend tightly. You whisper to her that everything is going to be alright, but you know that it won't. The two of you
      fall asleep together, exhausted from crying. You feel so lonely, you miss your family, your relatives and your friends. You have had a
      hole in your heart ever since you left. You haven't found anything that could fill the void yet, and you don't know what could.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day at work, you can't hold your tears in, and Zane pulls you aside and asks what's going on. You break down and confess to him, everything.
      You tell him that you're a girl, that you ran away from home 4 years ago, and that your only friend in the world is sick.
      First, you feel a cold terror sweeping over you, what did you just say? Did you just reveal everything you've hid for the past years?
      To a man that's practically a stranger? You shake your head. Zane surprises you, by embracing you and hugging you tightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry to hear that." he whispers to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your face is buried in his chest, and you take a deep breath. He smells of spices and herbs. You look up at him and wipe your tears from your eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're not mad?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Zane shakes his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've proven a good and loyal worker, I am not mad at you."
    </p>
    <p>
      He lifts your chin up with his fingers and smiles at you. You feel your heart beating faster when your eyes meet his dark brown eyes. You turn your head
      away, and blush slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take a couple of days off, and go be with your friend, she needs you right now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you!" you smile gratefully at Zane.
    </p>
    <p>
      During your time off, you help Banu to the best of your ability, but you aren't a doctor. You've also not been able to get Zane out of your head. The way
      he smiled at you, the way he held you, his smell, and his eyes. You see him when you close your eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is with light steps that you make your way to work, eager to see Zane again. You open the door to the shop and announce that you're here. No reply.
      You decide to check in the back, and Zane is there with an older man who you assume is his father. He turns around when you enter the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You!" he sneers.
    </p>
    <p>
        You are shocked and confused, you have no idea what's going on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You." the man repeats in a lower voice, but still as hostile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse me, sir?" you say politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get out of this shop and never come back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My boy told me about you, you whore." father snaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father..." Zane speaks up, but his father quiets him with a finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get OUT!" his father yells at you.
    </p>
    <p>
      He picks up a glass and throws it at you, luckily he misses and you run out of the store.
    </p>
    <p>
      You run as fast as you can, for as long as you can. Then you fall down in a heap and cry your eyes out. You think of going back to the store to talk
      to Zane. You know there isn't any use though. Zane is fully deferring to his father, and will most likely not have anything else to do with you. You understand
      controlling fathers, and you can't do anything about it.
