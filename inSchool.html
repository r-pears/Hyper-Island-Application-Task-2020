    <h1>In School</h1>
    <p>
      You like going to school, every morning you wake up, have breakfast and then you leave for school. You join the other boys leaving the village,
      and a few miles away you join up with boys from other villages. The walk is pretty long, almost 2 hours, you and Callan usually goof around and
      before you know it, you're at school.
      Your teacher is called Mr. Webb, he's from Scotland. The reason he's in Africa is because he wanted to make a change in the under developed countries,
      you're not really sure what that means. Mr. Webb is young, tall, and has a thick Scottish accent, you like him a lot - he's funny and knowledgeable.
      You aren't a genius, but you still have a pretty good head on your shoulders. You enjoy math, and science - you are eager to learn about technology.
      Mr. Webb has noticed your interest and is trying to encourage you, by lending you books about modern technology.
      Your school is a three floor white concrete building, your classroom is on the bottom floor. It's quite a big room, with white walls, your wooden desks'
      top opens like a lid, so you can store pens and books inside. In the back of the room, there's a wooden door, leading to Mr. Webb's office.
    </p>
    <p>
      You're sitting in class, the subject is history. You're bored by this war and that war, and you lean back on your chair and yawn. Callan is sitting next to you, taking
      notes. You reach over and poke him in his ribs. He turns his head to look at you, and cocks an eyebrow up in question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you doing after school?" you whisper to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The same as usual?" he whispers back without looking at you, slight annoyance creeping into his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How about we do something else? An adventure?" this catches his attention, and he turns his head towards you.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did you have in mind?" his voice raises slightly in excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys around you glances at you, and Callan lowers his voice to a whisper again.
      You grin at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will see after school" you wiggle your eyebrows at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come on, man. Tell me!" his attention is fully on you, he doesn't notice that he's almost yelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Turray," Mr. Ward's attention turns to the two of you, "I am glad that you find history so compelling that you want to hear more."
    </p>
    <p>
      Callan turns towards Mr. Ward, but he doesn't say anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You should keep your excitement to the minimum and listen to the rest of the lecture."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Mr. Ward." Callan says and glares at you from the corner of his eyes. You do your best to keep from laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the final class for the day, and Mr. Webb is talking about your futures. That going back to becoming a farmer isn't the only alternative,
      some boys in the class protests that they will have to take care of their family. It's very rare that anybody graduates school. Most families
      can only afford a few years in school - the tuition, books, and school uniforms. And many families see it as a waste of time and money to send any
      child to school. And if they have to pick they rather spend that money on a boy than a girl. You listen intently on Mr. Webb, you don't really want to
      go back home to the village and become a farmer. You'd like to travel and see the world, and explore other cultures.
      Mr. Webb is saying that the boys who graduate school, can apply to college or university. He also explains to the class that you don't have to be
      rich to be able to continue with your education. You can apply for a wide variety of scholarships that can cover your tuition fees, and housing.
      This creates a small spark inside of you, a want to go to college or university. Maybe, you don't have to become a farmer after all, and you can get
      another job, in a city, or maybe even in another country. This thought creates a small smile on your lips.
