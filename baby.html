    <h1>Your Baby</h1>
    <p>
      You're exhausted, laying on the hospital bed. A nurse hands you your baby for the first time. It's a baby girl, a healthy baby girl.
      You look at her, and you start crying, tears of joy. You're gasping for breath, holding your baby girl tight to you. She's snuggling
      up in the crook of your neck, content. You stroke her back, thinking about your own mother, when she gave birth to you. And you wish that
      she'd been here with you. To see this moment of joy. You suddenly feel very lonely in this world, no family left and you haven't made
      any friends either. Your baby girl drools all over your neck, and you start laughing, the hole in your heart doesn't feel so empty
      anymore. But there is a dark cloud hanging over your happy ending. You can't help but think back on that moment, the feeling, when
      you sold your virginity to that young man for a ticket out of the country. Your baby girl is a reminder of that man, she has his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      You love your baby girl, but you also hate what she reminds you off. You hate yourself because you know it's not the baby's fault, it's
      your own. You made that the decision back then, you and only you. The baby is innocent. It's a two-edged blade, on the one hand
      that decision gave you your baby girl, your wonderful daughter whom you love with all your heart. On the other hand, she is a constant
      reminder of your failure of not being sold by anybody, not your father, not yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      You try to do what's best for your daughter, but it is hard. You constantly wonder if you've made the right decisions in your life.
      Are you better off running from your problems? You will never know, you did what you had to do. What you thought was right at that time.
      You only have one life, and you do what's best in that second you have to make a decision. No matter how big or small, life consists of
      these decisions. Some decisions, nobody should be forced to make, but in the end - all you can do is survive.
