    <h1>Thank You</h1>
    <p>
      Thank you for taking your time to read my story. I hope that this stays with you and prompts you to take action.
      Daily, there are millions of girls, and boys, who are mistreated. And we can't keep turn a blind eye towards this and hope that it
      just goes away, because it won't. We need to take action, together, to stop the gender inequalities and make a better world,
      a better tomorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember that heroes do what's right, and not what's easy. Will you be a hero?
