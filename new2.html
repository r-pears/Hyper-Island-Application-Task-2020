    <h1>A New Beginning</h1>
    <p>
      You're exhausted, holding your newborn baby in your arms. It's so innocent, and adorable. Looking up at you with its curious dark brown eyes.
      You feel joy spreading throughout your body, radiating warmth. You look at your baby, and all you feel is love towards it. In this moment, you
      understand how your mother felt, so long ago. You love your baby, and you want what's best for it. It doesn't matter who it will grow to be, it will
      always be loved and cherished by you.
    </p>
    <p>
      You feel a resolve growing inside of you. Your baby deserves the best, all the possibilities to succeed, and you want to make that happen.
      You realize that things have to change. It doesn't matter what sex your baby has, it should be allowed to live a happy and full life no matter what.
      You want your baby to have the right to be whoever it want to be. And most importantly, when the time comes, be with whoever it want to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your life could have been so different, if you had married someone you loved. It is too late for you, you were given away as a child. Nothing
      will change your destiny. On the other hand, your baby's future is unknown, ready to be forged into a great person, if given a chance. Therefore,
      you know what you have to do. You need to stand up for it, stand up for changes and equal rights.
      You no longer want to turn a blind eye towards the injustices around you. You know it's easier to ignore than to fight, but taking the easy way
      isn't always right.
    </p>
    <p>
      You think about your own family, your sisters, your cousins. You've never got a chance to live. You were born a commodity, owned by your father.
      Until you got married to your husband, and now, you're owned by him. If he were to die, you wouldn't inherit him. You would have nothing. You'd
      belong to your closest male relative, who would make all your decisions regarding your life. This is not how you want it, and it isn't anything
      you'd wish on your worst enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      You haven't made anything with your life. You're not proud of anything in your past. The only accomplishment you have is the birth of your
      baby. And that is the best feat in the world! Now, you have to give your baby the best chance to survive and be happy. You are going to do
      everything you can to be your child's hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      And heroes do what is right, not what is easy.
