    <h1>The Lazy Person's Guide to Saving the World</h1>
    <p>
      The Sustainable Development Goals are important, world-changing
      objectives that will require cooperation among governments, international
      organizations and world leaders. It seems impossible that the average
      person can make an impact. Should you just give up?
    </p>
    <p>
      No! Change starts with you. Seriously. Every human on earth - even the
      most indifferent, laziest person among us - is part of the solution.
      Fortunately, there are some easy things we can adopt into our routines,
      that, if we all do it, will make a big difference.
    </p>
    <p id="guideTag">
      Have a look at just a few of many things you can do to make an impact!

      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Save electricity by plugging appliances into a power strip
            and turning them off completely when not in use, including your computer.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stop paper bank statements and pay your bills online of via mobile.
          </li>
          <li>
            Speak up! Ask your local and national authorities to engage in initiatives
            that don't harm people or the planet. You can also voice your support for the
            Paris Agreement and ask your country to ratify it or sign it if it hasn't yet.
          </li>
          <li>
            Turn off the lights. Your TV or computer screen provides a cosy glow,
            so turn off other lights if you don't need them.
          </li>
          <li>
            Do a bit of online research and buy only from companies that you know
            have sustainable practices and don't harm the enviroment.
          </li>
          <li>
            Report online bullies. If you notice harassment on a message board or
            in a chat room, flag that person.
          </li>
          <li>
            In addition to the above, offset your remaining carbon emissions!
            You can calculate your carbon footprint and purchase climate credits from
            Climate Neutral Now. In this way, you help reduce global emissions faster!
          </li>

      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Air dry. Let your hair and clothes dry naturally instead of running a machine.
            If you do wash your clothes, make sure the load is full.
          </li>
          <li>
            Take short showers. Bathtubs require gallons more water than a 5-10 minute shower.
          </li>
          <li>
            Eat less meat, poultry, and fish. More resources are used to provide meat
            than plants.
          </li>
          <li>
            Compost - composting food scraps can reduce climate impact while
            also recycling nutrients.
          </li>
          <li>
            Recycling paper, plastic, glass, and aluminium keeps landfills from growing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Buy minimally packaged goods.
          </li>
          <li>
            Plug air leaks in windows and doors to increase energy efficiency.
          </li>
          <li>
            Adjust your thermostat, lower in the winter, higher in summer.
          </li>
          <li>
            Replace old appliances with energy efficient models and light bulbs.
          </li>

      <h2>Things you can do in your neighbourhood</h2>
      <p id="level3Tag">Level 3</p>
      <p id="3Tag">Neighbourhood Nice Guy</p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Shop local. Supporting neighbourhood businesses keeps people employed
            and helps prevent trucks from driving far distances.
          </li>
          <li>
            Let your favourite businesses know that ocean-friendly seafood
            is on your shopping list.
          </li>
          <li>
            Shop only for sustainable seafood. There are now many apps that will
            tell you what is safe to consume.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bike, walk, or take public transport. Save the car trips for when
            you've got a big group.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use a refillable water bottle and coffee cup. Cut down on waste and
            maybe even save money at the coffee shop.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bring your own bag when you shop. Pass on the plastic bag and start
            carrying your own reusable totes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Take fewer napkins. You don't need a handful of napkins to eat your
            takeout. Take just what you need.
          </li>
          <li>
            Shop vintage. Brand-new isn't necessarily the best. See what you can
            repurpose from second-hand shops.
          </li>
          <li>
            Donate what you don't use. Local charities will give your gently used
            clothes, books, and furniture a new life.
          </li>
          <li>
            Take advantage of your right to elect the leaders in your country
            and local community.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Give fruits or snacks that you don't want to someone who needs
            and is asking for help.
          </li>
          <li>
            Does everyone at work have access to healthcare? Find out what
            your rights are to work. Fight against inequality.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mentor young people. It's a thoughtful, inspiring, and a powerful
            way to guide someone towards a better future.
          </li>
          <li>
            Voice your support for equal pay for equal work.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lend your voice to talk about the lack of toilets in many communities
            around the world!
          </li>
          <li>
            Make sure your company uses energy efficient heating and cooling technology.
          </li>
          <li>
            Raise your voice against any type of discrimination in your office. Everyone
            is equal regardless of their gender, race, sexual orientation, social background,
            and physical abilites.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bike, walk, or take public transportation to work. Save the car trips
            for when you've got a big group.
          </li>
          <li>
            Organize a No Impact Week at work. Learn to live more sustainably
