    <h1>Hideout</h1>
    <p>
      David leads you to his car, unlocks it with shaky fingers, and ushers you into the passenger seat. He jogs around the car and gets into the driver's
      seat. His hands are shaking and he misses the ignition. You grab his hands, and look into his eyes, and he takes a deep breath and calms down
      enough to get the car to start.
    </p>
    <p>
      David drives you to Mr. Ward's house, who lets you in quietly. David gives you a tight hug.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good luck, we all love you." he whispers in your ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      You hug him extra hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell Ma, and everyone, that I love them always." you sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      David nods, his eyes red with tears, before he slips out the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ward grabs your hand and squeezes it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you alright, Rose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      You nod slowly, tears still streaming down your face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, thank you, Mr. Ward."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ward makes a face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rose, please. Call me Rob."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Okay." you smile weakly, "Rob."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get some rest, we'll leave early tomorrow morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      You look at him in confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where are we going? I thought I was going to hide here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can't hide for the rest of your life. I have a plane ticket for you to leave."
    </p>
    <p>
      You look at him with horror on your face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm leaving? On my own?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I go with you it will be suspicious. I will give you enough money to get a fresh start."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I also wrote a letter of recommendation and attached your grades, if you want to apply to university somewhere."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ward smiles at you, and you feel a glimmer of hope in your stomach. Will this actually work? Will you be free? Free to live your
      life the way you want to? You can't believe that this is really happening!
    </p>
    <p>
      That night you can't fall asleep, you're too excited about everything that's happening. But at the same time, you're equally sad, you're
      never going to be able to see your family again. Ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ward comes for you in the middle of the night, and he hands you a backpack. It contains some spare clothes, and money. He brings you to his truck,
      and he drives you to the airport. The ride over is silent. You don't know how to express your gratitude and Mr. Ward seems extremely nervous, he's
      constantly checking the rearview mirrors.
    </p>
    <p>
      You reach the international airport, and Mr. Ward parks to drop you off. You hug him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you!" you smile at him, "I couldn't have done this without your help."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ward smiles at you.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good luck, kid. I hope you find your happiness."
    </p>
    <p>
      You walk into the airport with your ticket in your hand. It's a one-way ticket to a new life.
