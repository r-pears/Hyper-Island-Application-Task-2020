    <h1>Wedding Drums</h1>
    <p>
      You're standing at the altar, the minister in front of you. The beating of the wedding drums are vibrating through your body. The beating is alive,
      you can touch it, feel it. You're wearing a new suit, your father took you to a tailor and got you a, as he calls it 'proper suit'. It has taken
      some time, but your and Neela's fathers have finally agreed on a suitable dowry. Your father seems very pleased with the deal, you have no idea
      what went down between them. You asked your father but he said it is something you'll learn when you're marrying off your future children.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your hands are clammy, you're nervous. You can hear your heart beating. This is the moment you've been waiting for your entire life. To marry the
      love of your life. It is perfect, almost, you still feel like there is something missing. You feel like there is a hole missing in your heart.
      You've always imagined that your best friend, and brother, would be standing by your side when you get married. You know that Callan isn't your best
      friend any more, you've not seen him since you started university. You can't help but think about him. Your cousin, David, has been supporting you
      through this entire journey, but he doesn't understand you the way that Callan did. You shake your head, and mentally slap yourself. This is
      your wedding day, the happiest day in your life, you need to focus on you and your soon to be wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      You turn around and your breath is stuck in your throat. Neela is standing
      there, in a beautiful white wedding dress. It is very simple, but elegant, and Neela is absolutely glowing. She has one hand on her father's arm and holding
      a rose in her other hand. The drummers are beating their drums harder, and faster. This creates a hum in the air, the people gathered in the church are
      swaying in rythm to the drums. You feel a hard knot growing in your stomach. You wish that your family could have been here. You haven't seen your sisters
      since you left for university. And you've only seen your mother thrice in that time. You've asked your father about them, but he won't talk about them.
      All you've gathered is that he's married off all your sisters to men he found suitable, meaning those who paid the most. You feel sad thinking about how
      they didn't get to marry for love, they won't ever feel like you do in this moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      This reminds you of your 7th birthday, when your Faith was looking at you with such envy and hatred for being treated differently than they are. You know
      that you are more fortunate being a man in this region, but it isn't your fault. You didn't choose to be born. You can only affect your own choices.
      What you do with your life, and how you treat your future wife. She has been a possession of her father, and now, she will become yours. The only
      way that she can divorce you is if her family can pay the dowry back.
    </p>
    <p>
      The drums intensity increases until they reach their peak and there is a slow and steady sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      *THUMP*
    </p>
    <p>
      Neela and her father slowly approach the altar.
    </p>
    <p>
      *THUMP*
    </p>
    <p>
      With a final beat of the drum, Neela and her father have reached you.
      Neela beams at you, while her father shakes your hand. You both turn towards the minister. He is an elder in the village, his hair is almost white. He
      has a long white beard. He turns to address the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now, before God, our ancestors, and the circle of brothers and sisters gathered today, Neela King and James Nelson will state their vows."
    </p>
    <p>
      You and Neela turn to the table next to you. On the table is a big ceramic bowl, and many small glass containers with different herbs in them.
      Neela smiles at you, she raises her hand, you notice that she's shaking slightly. She looks you in the eyes, and begin to cite her vows.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To you, my beloved, I entrust you, alone my recipe for love."
    </p>
    <p>
      Neela reaches for the ceramic bowl, and continues.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's made with herbs from Africa, our Motherland and includes Grains of Paradise, to represent the haven I will create for you to come home to each day."
    </p>
    <p>
      She grabs the small glass containers and pours the content into the bowl while stating their meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jasmine, for the sweet spirit that will fill our lives; and, cayenne, for the spice that will fill our nights."
    </p>
    <p>
      You swallow hard when Neela says nights, you two haven't had sex yet. It's very frowned upon to have sex before marriage, especially for women.
      They are usually accused of being whores, and you don't want any rumors about Neela. You haven't told her that you're a virgin too. It isn't
      as common for men to be virgins up until they get married. However, you've chosen to wait to have sex with someone you love. You have a suspicion
      that the incident with Callan turned you away from wanting sex without having any emotional connection first.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neela hands the bowl over to you with shaking hands. You hold the bowl steadily and look into her eyes. Your voice is clear and steady when you speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And to you, my love, I offer mustard seeds, to represent the faith I have in you and in our love."
    </p>
    <p>
      You add the ingredients into the ceramic bowl while citing the rest of your vow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Allspice, because you have all the spice I could possibly ever need; and thyme to represent my vow to love you forever."
    </p>
    <p>
      You hold the bowl up for the crowd to see, with the finished ingredients. You slowly put it back down on the table and turn
      towards your soon to be wife. She smiles widely at you, you feel loved and happy. Neela's youngest sister walks up to you
      carrying your wedding rings. You grab one ring, Neela holds out her left hand. You grab her hand between yours and speak
      clearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "With this ring, I wed thee."
    </p>
    <p>
      You see Neela fumble a little when she grabs your ring, you hold out your left hand to her. With shaking fingers she
      slides the ring onto your finger with the words:
    </p>
    <p>
      "With this ring, I wed thee."
    </p>
    <p>
      The minister clears his throat and speaks loudly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I now pronounce you, husband and wife." he smiles warmly, "You may now kiss the bride."
    </p>
    <p>
      You look into Neela's eyes, smile and lean in and kiss her softly. You straighten your back and smile and your new wife. The crowd present
      cheers loudly and clap their hands. Neela puts her hand on your arm, and you lead her away from the altar, towards your future.
