    <h1>Accept Kyan</h1>
    <p>
      Your love for your boy is stronger than anything else in this world, you know that it must have been a huge effort on his part to tell
      you the truth about his sexuality. You also know that there is no chance at all for Kyan to be able to live freely in this part of the world.
      It doesn't matter where you live, there will always be people who are against homosexuality, but there are countries that are more progressive
      than others. However, moving to those countries which are predominately inhabited by Caucasians, you know that you might face racism towards
      you and your family because of your African origin. It is a risk you're willing to take.
    </p>
    <p>
      You walk up to Kyan's room, and stop outside of his door. You take a deep breath and then knock on the door, no answer. You knock again, and call
      out to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Son, open the door."
    </p>
    <p>
      The door slowly, tentatively, opens and Kyan is looking at you. You can tell he's been crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you let me in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Kyan nods, and walks into his room, you follow him and close the door behind you. Kyan sits down on his bed, and you sit down next to him. He
      is twisting his hands in his lap. You place and arm around his shoulders and kiss his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I love you, and I accept you." you can feel Kyan relaxing, "Thank you for telling me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kyan throws his arms around you, hugging you tightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you!" he cries against your chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But..." you say.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kyan dries his eyes and look up at you.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We can't stay here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know that the penalty for homosexuality is a lifetime in prison."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kyan freezes, and you aren't sure if he knew or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have to move."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Europe or North America."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kyan nods slowly. You get up to your feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am going to talk to your mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kyan opens his mouth but you interrupt him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I won't tell her about you, it's not my business to tell anybody."
    </p>
    <p>
      You leave Kyan's room to go find your wife. You sigh heavily, you know that this won't be easy.
    </p>
    <p>
      You and Neela had a huge fight about moving, you ended up telling her that this was for your family's best. That you had to do this,
      you gave her an option of staying or coming with. Although, you knew that it wasn't really an option. Neela could never stay while
      the rest of the family left. Her family would never take her back, and she would have no security or anywhere to live. It was with
      a heavy heart you made all the arrangements to move your family.
