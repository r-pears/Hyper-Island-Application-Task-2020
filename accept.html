    <h1>The Letter</h1>
    <p>
      One day, when you come home. It's sitting there on the kitchen counter, waiting for you. A thick white envelope, with the emblem of
      the university of your dreams. You pick it up with shaking fingers, you examine it. You feel the weight of it. You examine the color.
      Anne is watching you expectantly, waiting for you to open it.
      You slowly, carefully open the envelope. You stare at it blankly for a minute before you slam it down on the bench in front of you.
    </p>
    <p>
      *ACCEPTED*
    </p>
    <p>
      Both you and Anne are laughing and screaming of joy. You can finally get everything you've ever dreamed of. You can get the life you've
      always wanted. You can be in charge of life changing decisions. You will be the hero of your story.
