    <h1>No School</h1>
    <p>
      You listen to your mother, and you don't go to school. Every morning, you watch the boys go to school, and you wonder if you made the right decision.
      Your mother seems pleased with you, that you've dropped the subject of going to school. You fetch the water from the village well every morning, then you
      play with the other children in the village. In the afternoon you help your mother with chores - such as mending clothes, preparing dinner, and washing clothes.
      In the evenings you often go over to David and watch him do homeworks, and prod him about what he's learned in school that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      You try and help your mother as much as possible. Your heart is breaking when you see her struggle to make sure that you and your sisters have food for the day.
      Here and there your overwhelmed with anger towards your father for abandoning your family. You know that the allowance he used to send your mother before you
      were born, wasn't nearly enough to cover your family's expenses. And after you were born and he found out he didn't get the son he wanted, he stopped sending
      your family money. Your mother is struggling every day, and you caught her not eating any food - she rations everything to you and your sisters.
      When the anger hits you, you usually feel angry at life and the unfairness in it. You think it's unfair that you (and other girls) aren't allowed to go to school,
      you think it's unfair that your family has to struggle, and your mother starving herself because women aren't employed. In these moments you swear that you
      will make things better for yourself and your family.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day when you come home after being out playing with the other children, you find your mother and two of your sisters crying.
      You stand in the entrance, casting a long shadow into the single room that your family lives in. Your mother and sisters look up at you
      and you enter the room. You don't know what has happened, but you go to your family and hug them. Your mother pulls you into a tight
      hug, and kisses your forehead. Her tears flowing, they are dripping on your head, but you don't care.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Chicken, your father was here..." your mother's voice cracks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your heart skips a beat, your father? He was here visiting? You feel
      sadness that you missed a chance to meet your father for the first time. You realize your oldest sister's birthday was a couple of days ago,
      that was probably why he was here right? To give her a present for turning 17. You don't understand why your family is crying over
      your father visiting. Then a hope sparks in your heart, maybe he gave you something too? You know he works in the capital and
      earns a lot of money.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ma, did father give me a present??" you blurt out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your mother stares at you for a second before pulling you into her arms again and starts rocking you back and forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, chicken. He didn't give you anything, he doesn't care about us." you know that she's trying to be cordial because he is your father,
      but you can hear the anger and hatred in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      And with that, the hope in your heart is extinguished.
      You feel foolish thinking that he was here for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why was he here?" you can't figure out what he was doing here, if he doesn't care about your family.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Chicken, he came for Clara."
    </p>
    <p>
      A small "Oh" escapes your lips, so he was here for your oldest sister's birthday.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he was here for Clara's birthday, why are you crying?" you frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Chicken, he wasn't here to give Clara anything." she grabs your shoulders and meets your eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rosie, look at me" she demands. You meet her brown, cold, and sad eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes that are always full of joy are now blank.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He came for Clara, he has arranged for her to get married..." she's still holding your gaze to make sure you understand what
      she's saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your mouth falls open, and you're taken back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Married? To whom?" you ask your mother, as you had no idea that Clara was even in love.
    </p>
    <p>
      You've heard your sisters sit by the
      fire in the evenings, gossiping about boys they find cute, but Clara hasn't mentioned anybody special.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rosie, this is a business transaction for your father." your mother hugs you.
    </p>
    <p>
      You're stunned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will she come back?" you whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She will marry a man in the neighbouring village. She will be able to visit, and we can visit her. But, she's not coming back home"
    </p>
    <p>
      Your sister is gone, you didn't even say goodbye.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will we go to the wedding?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Your mother shakes her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's taking place tomorrow. Your father has arranged it all. We cannot afford to go."
    </p>
    <p>
      Your chest feels tight, like somebody stabbed you with a knife and then twisted.
      A sob escapes your lips, and then another. Soon you're crying, your sisters are crying, your mother is crying.
      You're all huddling on the floor crying and hugging each other.
