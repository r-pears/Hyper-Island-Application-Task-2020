    <h1>Hideout</h1>
    <p>
      David leads you to a hostel, where he lives while studying at the university. You know that you can't stay long, but you have nowhere else to go.
      You know that your father is going to come here looking, sooner or later, and you don't want to put David in any danger. He is your cousin,
      the only person willing to help you out.
    </p>
    <p>
      David ushers you inside his room, it is a very small room - with a bed in the corner, a desk against the wall under the window, and a sink for washing
      up. As David closes the door behind you, you turn around and throw your arms around his neck and starts crying, you feel an immense relief over finally
      being free. But you know that your struggles have just begun, you need to find out what to do next. You need to move before your father finds you,
      you don't have the luxury of breathing out until you've put a good distance between you.
      However, the sun is starting to set, and you don't want to spend the night on the streets. You decide to risk staying the night at David's and leave
      at first light.
    </p>
    <p>
      You spend the night in a restless sleep. You awake early when the sun starts to shine in through the window. You get up and get dressed, David has
      given you some of your younger cousin's clothes that will fit you better than David's. You look at yourself in the mirror, and you can barely recognize
      yourself. You've always only worn dresses, seeing yourself in jeans, t-shirt, an unbuttoned shirt, and a baseball cap, is extremely different. You will
      definately pass as a young boy. David gives you some bread for breakfast. After you're finished eating, you both stare at each other for a moment,
      and you start to tear up. You blink your tears away, this is going to be the hardest time of your life. David gives you a tight hug.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good luck, lil cousin." he whispers in your ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you for everything you've done."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait a second."
    </p>
    <p>
      David hands you a black backpack, you look puzzled at him and then examines the content. There is a blanket, a flashlight, some spare clothes, dried rations,
      and some money. You start to tear up again, and you throw your arms around his neck hugging him. He carefully puts his big arms around you, and embraces you
      warmly. You feel loved. For a moment you have second thoughts, do you really want to leave your family behind? Everyone you've ever loved, and who loves you?
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer is 'Yes', you don't have any choice but to leave. You have no life here, no future at all. You don't know what the future has in store for you
      when you leave. One thing you know for sure though, it can't be worse than staying.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell Ma and everyone that I love them, okay?"
    </p>
    <p>
      David nods in response and lets you go. You open the door to his room, take a deep breath and enters the unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is still very early in the morning, barely any people are out yet. The sun is low, but the day is already hot. You make your way over to the bus station,
      and you buy a ticket to the neighboring city. You've decided that you have to leave the country, that's the only way to ensure that your father can never find
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bus is old, the air conditioner is broken, it is extremely hot. It is crowded, there aren't enough seats for everybody to sit, most people are standing, packed
      together like a box of sardines. The smell is horrible, the heat combined with bad hygiene mix terrible with each other. You do your best to breathe through your
      mouth instead of your nose, but the pungent smell still doesn't escape your nose.
