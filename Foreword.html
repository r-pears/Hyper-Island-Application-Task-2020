      <h1>Hyper Island Application Task 2020</h1>
      <p>
        This work is created as my application task for Hyper Island 2020. It is a work of fiction based on true events that are occuring daily all over the world.
        I've written this with the intent of raising awareness of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. The main focus is <a href="Facts.html#goals5">gender equality</a>, but
        it highlights other goals as well.
        The statistics have gone up, and the world is a better place,
        but that doesn't mean that we're done and can give up.
        There are still countries that don't have the basic human rights,
        the UN pledged to Leave No One Behind.
      </p>
      <blockquote cite="https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals.html">
        The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), also known as the Global Goals,
        were adopted by all United States Nations Member States in 2015 as
        a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure
        that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030.

        If you want to read more about the UN Sustainable Development Goals, <a href="Facts.html">click here.</a>
        You can read why the goals are important, and what you can do to help.
        Now you're thinking what can I do alone? I can't change anything, that's
        up for governments and world leaders.
        You're wrong, every contribution helps, small or large.
        Therefore, the UN has published a <a href="Guide.html">Lazy Person's Guide to Saving the World.</a>
        You don't have to do everything on that list, but if you can do a few things.
        All those few things add up, and in the end, we've made a change.

        This isn't my story, I wrote it, but it's not about me. Why should you read
        it and why should you care?
        Because, it is someone's story. It is someone's life, someone's future.
        And it isn't someone, it's millions. Millions of girls and boys.
