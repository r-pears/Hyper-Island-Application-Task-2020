    <h1>Your Wedding Day</h1>
    <p>
      You haven't slept for days. You're sitting watching your mother recover, she wakes up for an hour or so, and then falls back asleep.
      Aunt Susan said that your mother will recover fully in time. You don't want your mother to hurt, you realize you don't want to leave
      your family. You love your mother and your sisters, and the thought of never seeing them again hurts too much. There's a rustle behind you,
      and your turn your head to see who it is. David steps into your home, he has a very serious look on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you decided?" he's focusing on a spot somewhere above your head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yea" you say weakly.
    </p>
    <p>
      You try your best to be strong and hold back the sob that's building in your chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm going with my father to get married, I can't walk away from my family." you catch his gaze, "All of my family."
    </p>
    <p>
      He nods, realizing that you mean your aunt and your cousins as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      You're packing your belongings. You don't own any suitcase, but you found a plastic bag that will have to do. You don't have much stuff.
      You take out the few clothes you own, you straighten them and fold them neatly and put them in your bag. The only personal affections
      in your possession are your old stuffed bunny, and the skipping rope your mother gave you on your 7th birthday.
      You hug your bunny, you smell it. The smells brings back so many happy childhood memories. You start quietly sobbing, hugging your bunny.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time has come, your father has come in his truck to take you away to your new life. He is outside your home, yelling at you to come.
      You squat down next to your mother's bed. She looks up at you, and strokes your cheek.
      You bend down and give her a hug.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I love you, Ma." you whisper as you cry against her chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I love you, Chicken." she whispers back as she's stroking your back with her hands, "I'm sorry I couldn't give you a better life."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her words takes you by surprise, up until your father showed up the other day, you've always thought your mother wanted you to become like her,
      a 'good wife'. Did she have other dreams and aspirations? Did she wish for other things in life? Did she want other things for you?
      You're pulled out of your thoughts by your father, who yanks you up on your feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Girl, let's go. We don't have all day." he huffs at you.
    </p>
    <p>
      You feel tears burning in the corner of your eyes, but you're holding them back. You follow your father out and get in the back of his truck.
      You turn around and watch your home grow smaller as you're driving away. You stare blankly into the distance, even though your home
      has long since vanished out of view.
