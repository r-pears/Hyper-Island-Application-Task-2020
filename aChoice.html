    <h1>A Choice</h1>
    <p>
      You managed to get out of the country fairly easily. The backpack with supplies that David gave you really saved your life during those times.
      You have no idea if your father ever found out that David helped you escape your fate, but you hope not. You wish every day that your mother,
      sisters, Susan, and David are fine, that your father hasn't retaliated against your loved ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      You haven't decided what to do now. Your money, and the money David gave you, are all out. You spent it all on the bus tickets out from the country.
      You don't have any education, you don't know how to read or write. There is probably not any chance for you to move to a Western country, and go to
      school, but maybe you could get there and get a job. If you move to a Western country, you might be able to get a decent life. However, you are aware
      that there are racism and segregation. You don't know if you want to face that on your own, without any friends or family, without any support.
      But that raises another question, how are you going to support yourself if you stay here? Almost all regions of Africa is dominated by males, which
      is one reason that you left. Women aren't allowed to work, with very few exceptions, aren't allowed to own property. How are you going to survive if
      you stay on the continent?
    </p>
    <p>
      You're wandering down the street, looking for a place to stay, you're still dressed like a boy and is mostly ignored. It is starting to get dark,
      and you haven't found any 'safe' place to spend the night at.
      You head down an alley to your left, immediately you notice that something is strange. You eye the surroundings warily, you see the shadows of
      figures further down, but you can't see them clearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      You carefully step forward. Suddenly, the smell hits you - a mix of urine, sweat, and something rotten. You almost gag from the smell, you bring up
      your arm to cover your mouth with your sleeve. You move deeper into the alley, you can now make out the shadowy figures. They are couples, men and
      women, but also men and men. They're kissing and half naked, with horror you realize that they are having sex. You gasp and take a step back.
      You feel a hand on your shoulder, spinning you around.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hello there, darling." a young woman drawls.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looks like she's about your age, her face is heavily covered with makeup. She is very pretty, she is dressed in a tight red dress, it has a
      deep cleavage showing off her breasts, and the dress ends mid thigh leaving her long legs bare.
      She looks surprised at your age, but she recovers quickly. She smiles coyly
      at you, put a hand on your shoulder and leans close to you and whispers in your ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can teach you a thing or two, boy."
    </p>
    <p>
      You recoil from her touch, like she had given you an electric shock. You open your mouth to speak, but you find yourself at a loss for words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You..." she says, squinting at your face, "You're not a boy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not." you whisper in confirmation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I can still show you a good time." she smiles coyly again, "If you can pay?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I...I don't have any money." you stammer, "But, I'm not here for you. That."
    </p>
    <p>
      You indicate to the couples behind the girl. You blush, you feel like your cheeks are on fire. You're lucky that it's dark right now, and nobody can
      see the crimson color your cheeks have taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you here for then?" her accent and posture changes immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm looking for a place to spend the night." you look down at your feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go home, kid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't have a home." you whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you run away?"
    </p>
    <p>
      You nod in answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why? Didn't like the posh life?" she asks condescendingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your anger flares up for a moment, anger and hurt about everything you've lost and you glare at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't know me." you say icily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl laughs at you.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then tell me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I ran away, cause I didn't want to marry." you snap.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl's features softens, and she looks at you, genuinely for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come with me." she says and starts to walk away.
    </p>
    <p>
      You hesistate for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come on." she says over her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      You follow her down the alley, she unlocks a door and steps in, locks the heavily bolted door behind her. Fear starts to fill your body,
      what if you're getting murdered? Or kidnapped? Or sold? You shouldn't have come here. The girl seems to sense the fear in you.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Relax, I'm not going to hurt you." she says.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My name's Banu."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rose." your name barely escapes your lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a pretty name, how did you end up here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      You tell Banu how you were to be married to an older man you've never met, and you didn't want to. You tell her how your cousin David helped you
      run away, but that you've used all your money. Banu patiently listens to your story, and she looks at you with pity in her eyes.
      You tell her how you have run out of options, she then says something that makes your heart skip a beat:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You could earn some money on the street before moving on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I..." you stutter, "I can't do that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?" Banu cocks an eyebrow at you, "It's not that hard. Most of the time it's over in a minute."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But..." you protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banu holds up one hand to make you be quiet and listen to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I have a horrible customer, I think about killing them. You know, to pass the time." she shrugs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's not as bad as you think, and you make good money." she continues, "Just watch out for the assholes who wants to do it without a condom."
    </p>
    <p>
      Banu continues to explain the ropes about prostitution in these parts of the city. She says it's fairly safe, and good money. You could probably
      work for a few months and then have enough for a ticket out of here, and enough money to start over in a Western country. There is only one problem
      though.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm a virgin." you whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banu stops and stares at you for a second.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How..." she opens her mouth, but shuts it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's great."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?" you ask confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A virgin is worth a lot of money."
    </p>
    <p>
      You are taken aback by that statement. Banu tells you that you can earn more than enough money to get out of here, by selling your virginity. You
      don't know how to feel about this, it is sort of the thing you wanted to flee from. Your father selling you and your virginity to some man you've never
      met. Are you willing to sell the exact same thing for a ticket out of here? Or will you try to find another way to leave?
