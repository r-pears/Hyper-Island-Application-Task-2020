    <h1>An Ending</h1>
    <p>
      Every life has a beginning and an end. You had no control over your life's start, nor how it will end. You don't know how it will end,
      but you know that you didn't get what you wanted. Your life didn't turn into this great adventure that you wanted. You've seen the deepest
      and darkest side of human beings. How cruel they are capable of being. But you've also seen how good and kind they can be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your life was full of decisions you made, because you thought they were best at the time. You did what you could to survive, and live.
      You will never know if those decisions you made were the best for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      You wanted to see the world, but you never managed to save up enough money to get out of the country. You lived with Banu and helped her,
      until the end. You saw how horrible the disease is, and what it does to people and relationships. You sometimes thought that you saw a
      glimpse of Zane through the crowd. You know that he married a young girl from a wealthy merchant family.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have managed to survive, but you haven't lived. You miss your family and relatives, and you don't know if you made the right decisions
      through life. You don't know if your family is alive and well, or if you have nephews and nieces. Your heart weights heavy with the knowledge
      that they probably think you ran away to a better life. You live a different life, but you don't know if it's better.
    </p>
    <p>
      You never ended up finding love, you never married. You didn't experience any of the things you dreamt of as a little girl.
