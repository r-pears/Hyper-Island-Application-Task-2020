    <h1>Your Conscience</h1>
    <p>
      You can't believe that you're standing here, on your own son's funeral. Your conscience is burning a hole into your soul, you can't help
      feeling that this is your fault. After Kyan came out as gay to you, you gave him two choices - suppress his sexuality or leave the country.
      He chose to suppress his sexuality, he didn't want to leave his family behind. You offered him money and a ticket to Canada, with the
      condition that he could never come back, or contact his family again. He declined your offer and wanted to stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kyan tried to be happy, he tried to suppress himself. He was unhappy, he never smiled again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kyan committed suicide at the age of 21. You blame yourself, you should have helped him more. You tried to make him feel loved and
      happy. But not being able to express his sexuality, became too much for him, and he couldn't live like this anymore.
      He left behind a letter for you.
    </p>

      <h3>Dear Papa</h3>
      <p>
        I love you, and I know you did what was best for me. I know you wanted me to be happy and safe. Ever since that day, I have been unable to
        be happy, or positive. There is nothing to look forward to if there is no love in life. There isn't any hope without love. I don't have
        any hope anymore. I can't keep living a fake life. I can't keep pretending that I am happy. I can't pretend that I am in love and
        attracted to women when I am not. I don't want to cause our family any shame. I definately don't want to spend the rest of my life in
        prison. But living a life without love, is a prison on its own.
      </p>
      <p>
        Love,
        Kyan
