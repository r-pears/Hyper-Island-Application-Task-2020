    <h1>Life Goes On</h1>
    <p>
      The incident on Callan's birthday, is something that you can never forget.
      Sometimes you still think about that terrible incident. You wonder if there was something else you could have done, saved Amara in any way.
      Or if you should have gone to the police station. There are
      times in the street that you think you see Amara, from the corner of your eye, but every time you turn to take a closer look, she isn't there.
      Every time you see a woman in a yellow dress your breath gets stuck in your lungs, and you see the bloody tore dress in front of you.
    </p>
    <p>
      You and Callan are still best friends, and you still do everything together. You never speak of the incident again. You have a feeling that Callan
      is still doing it, he goes to bars and parties a lot. You try to study and focus on your future, to forget your past.
      You aren't the best in school, but you are good enough to earn a scholarship to a university in the city. Your father is extremely proud over
      you, and bought you an apartment near the university as a present. You've decided to major in English. You have a dream of one day leaving this
      country. You want to see other parts of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      You've started university, and moved into your apartment. Your very own apartment, you're very happy, but you still can't forget Amara's face. Callan
      followed in his father's footstep and enlisted in the army. He is going through bootcamp at a base outside the city. Whenever he is off, he comes into
      the city to visit you. The two of you goes to party and hang out as you've always had. You try to be responsible and put your studies first, which you
      succeed with, most of the time anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are heading to the university library to study. You carefully open the door as to not disturb the other students inside. You step inside and head
      over to the desks that are set up to the side of the room. You see a girl sitting there, in a yellow dress. Immediately your mind is filled with bloody
      images, and your nose is smelling it. You hold your breath as you walk up closer to her. You're standing pretty close behind her, she notices you and turns
      around. The girl's face is unfamiliar, but very beautiful. You smile at her. She smiles at you. You can't help but lose yourself in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hi." she says shyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hi." you reply, you can feel your cheeks starting to burn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Uhm." you clear your throat, "Can I sit here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      You point to the desk next to hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes." she smiles, her eyes are shimmering.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Uh, I'm James." you say awkwardly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My name is Neela."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's very nice to meet you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nice to meet you too."
    </p>
    <p>
      From that moment, you spent almost every waking moment with Neela. You fell in love with her the moment you saw her. And for the first time,
      since that horrible day, you've been able to forget what happened and be happy. Neela makes you forget that anything else exists in this world,
      or anyone else for that matter. You are so enamored with her - she's beautiful, funny, and smart. She's studying to become a nurse. It's
      very rare with women at the university, but they do exist - mostly in the nursing program.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a long and hard fight with your father, you've finally received his permission to propose and marry Neela. Your father had planned for you
      to marry the daughter of an old friend of his. You convinced him to let you propose to Neela, you're still aware that there will be a lot of negotiating
      between your fathers, primarily regarding the dowry. It is also extremely rare to marry out of love, and not because of some business transaction.
      You know that you're lucky to be proposing to the love of your life. Your fathers have already agreed upon the marriage, but you still want to properly
      ask Neela.
    </p>
    <p>
      You asked Neela out on a date, and made a reservation at a fancy French restaurant. You borrowed your father's suit, and for the first time in your life you're
      wearing a tie. You arrived earlier than Neela. You're now sitting at a table waiting for her to show up. Your hands are clammy, and you feel like your
      entire body is covered with sweat. You're very nervous, hoping that she'll like this.
    </p>
    <p>
      "James." you look up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neela is standing in front of you, more beautiful than ever. She is wearing a dark green dress, and her short curls frame her perfect face. You stare at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "James?" she looks at you worriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her words unfreezes you, and you're moving again. You have already ordered two glasses of champagne, which are supposed to arrive any minute. You get up
      from your chair and dig around in your pocket for the ring. Your fingers find it and grip it tightly. Your eyes are still locked and you kneel in front of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Neela, will you marry me?" you ask, as you pull out the ring and hold it up to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes!" she exclaims, and throws her arms around you as you stand up.
