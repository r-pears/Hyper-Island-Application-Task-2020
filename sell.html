    <h1>Sell Your Virginity</h1>
    <p>
      You decided to sell your virginity, the allure of the money got the best of you. However, it didn't turn out the way you expected it. It was
      a much more painful and traumatic experience than you had expected. The young man whom you'd sold yourself too, also insisted on not wearing
      a condom, which was Banu's first rule. But the man insisted that he had paid for a virgin and that's what he was going to get, he would only
      pay a fifth of what he offered from the beginning if he was forced to wear a condom. You were a fool and greedy, you saw the chance to get
      out of here and start a new life in a Western country.
      You received the money, said goodbye to Banu, and thanked her, and left. You bought a one-way plane ticket to Canada.

      You arrived in Canada, full of hope of a new life. You managed to secure a small apartment and a job as a waitress at a local caf√©. It was
      enough for you to feel like you had achieved your goal. A fresh start. That's when you realized you were pregnant, with the man you sold
      your virginity to. Whose name you don't even know. You don't even live in the same country anymore. You felt hopeless, and you were debating
      having an abortion, but you couldn't do this. Not to an innocent baby. Yes, the father is a scumbag, but the child is completely innocent.
      You also had the option of putting the baby up for adoption, but that felt wrong to you. Knowing that your baby is somewhere else, with
      someone else. Loving someone else. You have left everyone who loves you behind. You had always hoped of starting a family of your own at
      one point in your life. But that point wasn't now, and not alone. You decided that you have to keep the baby.
