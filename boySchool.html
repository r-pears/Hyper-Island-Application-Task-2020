    <h1>It's Time for School!</h1>
    <p>
      Every morning you wake up extra early and go down to the well to get water for your family. Then you tell your mother that you're going to play with the
      other children in the village, there are so many that your mother couldn't ask everyone and find out where you really where. You then follow the boys until
      they meet up with three other groups of boys from other villages. Then you sneak into a group of unknown boys and pretend to be from the neighbouring village.
      You tell them that your name is "Darren", you're very shy, and you mostly watch the boys play from a distance during breaks.
      The first time you see the school, you're frozen solid out of fear and eagerness. The school building is a quite large, three story, white concrete building.
      Your classroom is on the bottom floor, the windows are covered with protection against insects. The benches are made out of wood, and they have a lid
      which you can open, and here you store your school books and pencils. There's a wooden door in the back, that leads to your teacher's office. You take a seat
      in the front of the classroom, right in front of the blackboard.

      Going to class is amazing,
      you love learning, and your teacher, Mr. Ward, is very knowledgeable and funny, he's Scottish, he moved here because he wanted to teach children in developing
      countries. You're not sure what "developing countries" mean, but you're sure that your country is one. Mr. Ward described them as poor countries, in need of
      a better educational system. He told your class that he dreamed of changing the world when he was younger, he want to inspire as many of you as possible to
      do something with your lives. Most of your class enjoy learning and are very diligent, but there are a few boys in your class that don't seem to want to be there,
      they often ask what the point of learning to read and write are, when they're just going to end up as farmers like their parents. Mr. Ward tells you
      that you all have the ability to do something else with your lives, he says that if you study well there is a chance that you'll be accepted into a University
      in the city when you're older. If that happens, the whole world is open with possiblities. He says you can become whatever you want, and you can travel, see the world.
      This becomes your dream, traveling, seeing all the beauty the world has to offer.

      As it turns out, you are extremely talented, and a quick learner. You love school, and you absorb new knowledge. After your first term in school, you now know
      how to read and write, do basic math, your country's geography and history.
      You've also made friends with few of the boys in your class, you have a best friend for the first time in your life! His name is Jared, and you share desk in class
      with him.
      The guilt of lying to your mother and sisters are eating at you, although you know that you'll learn far more from school than you would working the fields.
      Ever since you heard Mr. Ward talk about the possibility of earning a scholarship to a University in the capital, or one of the other major cities, you're working
      even harder. A dream is growing in the back of your head, you want to help other people, just like Mr. Ward came here to become a teacher to help others.
      Even if you're feeling guilty over the fact that you're lying to your family, you still feel that it's highly unfair that you (and other girls) aren't allowed to
      go to school. This ignites your hatred toward your father again. How could he abandon you and your family just because you're a girl? Would he have been proud
      over you for your achievements in school? Would he have been at your birthdays? You try and push these thoughts away, but from time to time they hit you
      and washes over you - leaving you feeling angry - for hating someone you've never met.
      You also avoid every boy from your own village, you make sure that they never see you, as soon as you spot someone you walk away or hide.
