    <h1>Happy Birthday</h1>
    <p>
      It's the evening before your 7th birthday. Your family, including your father is here to celebrate you. Your father brought a cake from
      the city! It's made of your favorite, chocolate! You've never seen anything this pretty before - it's three layers of chocolate cake with
      jam and custard in-between the layers, completely covered by a dark chocolate glaze, and topped with different fruits. It smells of sweet
      cacao and it makes your mouth literally water. You can't believe what you're seeing, you rub your eyes with your hands to make sure you're
      not dreaming. Nope, it's still here! You're really excited, and your father also brought you a couple birthday presents. You glance over to
      your mother, she's smiling at you, but you can see the shame on her face - the shame of not being able to give you any of this. Your
      father is the one earning money, and he's spoiling you. Your mother doesn't have anything to spare. You feel guilt creeping over you, you move
      over to your mother and give her a tight hug. She tenses up at first, but then she relaxes and returns your hug with warmth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I love you, Ma." you whisper into her ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I love you, too." she smiles hugely at you.
    </p>
    <p>
      You feel the love radiating from her. You close your eyes and enjoy this moment, you wish
      it could last forever. She smells of herbs and fresh air, being in her arms make you feel safe. You remember every time you got sick, hurt,
      or had a nightmare,
      your mother would hold you in her arms and you'd breathe her in, and she'd tell you that everything was going to be alright. She would always
      stroke your hair, and sing an old lullaby in a language you don't know. The lullaby would captivate you and the sparks from the fire
      become alive. It scared you at first, but it was also calming, it always comforted and soothed you.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hey, kid. Why don't you open your presents?" your father's voice snaps you back to reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      You look up at your mother, who isn't looking ashamed anymore, and she gives you an encouraging nod.
      You smile broadly, give your mother another hug and turn towards your presents.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first present is wrapped in brown paper with a green bow tied around it. You eagerly rip the paper of the present, and your hands shakingly
      reveal a backpack, its dark grey and black, with a white symbol of the brand in the front. You stare at it, can't believe it! You start examining it,
      checking all the pockets. You can feel your jaw aching from grinning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks, Pa" you exclaim.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're welcome, boy. It's for school, make me proud." he says sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I promise" you agree eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      You grab the next present, it's wrapped in a shiny silvery paper, with a blue ribbon around it. It's a very small box, and very light.
      You slowly unwrap it, delicately, and lift the lid to the box inside. It's a new pencil, you take it out and spin it between your fingers.
      It's your first pen, you're excited about starting school.
      You turn to the last present, it's pretty big, wrapped in red paper with a golden bow. You open your last present, and it's a brand new football - made
      of black and white leather patches.
      The smell of new leather hits your nostrils, and you hug the presents to your chest and turn to your family.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you!" you say, feeling your voice stock in your throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can feel tears starting to form in your eyes.
      You blink trying to get them away, but you fail. You can feel a single tear of happiness drip down your cheek.
      Your family comes up to hug you, one by one - your father, mother, and lastly your sisters. You're so happy. Your happiness is diminished by the dirty
      looks you're getting from your youngest sister, Faith. You're aware that your sisters never have gotten any presents, and that your father never show up for
      their birthdays. You know that your father doesn't show any interest for anyone else in the family.
      You swallow hard, and avoid Faith's glares.
      Your mother cuts up the cake, and hands out slices to your family. Your father growls at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why did you give me a small piece, woman?" he glares at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I...I'm sorry." she looks down at her feet, and hands him her plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      There's no more cake left. Your mother looks defeated. You feel anger flaring up
      inside of you.
      You hand your plate to your mother while glaring at your father in demonstration.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop being ungrateful, kid" he yells at you, looming over you.
    </p>
    <p>
      You cringe under his gaze, and you look down at the ground. You're expecting him to slap you, but no blow is coming.
      You look up in time to see your father stomp out, leaving both plates of cake untouched. He gets into his truck and drives off. You feel a knot in your stomach.
      Your mother squeezes your shoulder with her hand, and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're a good boy, and you will be a great man." she looks at you with affection in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      You reach up and wipe a tear away with your sleeve. Faith is no longer glaring at you, instead she's looking at you with pity in her eyes.
      You eat your cake in silence, it's not tasting as good as you thought it would. It's all bland in your mouth, you feel like you've
      disappointed your father. Your mother's kind words, are already long forgotten. The only thing occupying your mind is your father's
      scowl as he stomped out.
