    <h1>It's Time</h1>
    <p>
      You're standing in front of your new husband, his name is Jamir. He is not living up to the meaning of his name - which is highly good looking, admired
      and adored. You wince internally when you look at him. You know that you shouldn't judge him based on his appearance, but he is much older than you.
      You've read enough books to know that you should never judge a book after its covers. However, you're also an avid reader and you know that life isn't
      a fairytale - there isn't any 'And they lived happily ever after...'. You turn back to Jamir.
      He's in his late 50s, short, and bald. He's grinning at you, and he's missing most of his
      front teeth. You feel a cold shiver run down your spine. This is your future, he is your future. He is the future father of your children, this
      thought makes you feel vehemently sick to your stomach, for a second you almost throw up all over him. You are going to be his second wife,
      his first wife is living in the same village as your oldest sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wedding attendees are few - your father, Jamir's oldest son (who is older than you), and your uncle (on your father's side). The
      minister is speaking with a raspy voice, he sounds like he's been smoking for 50 years, when he turns to speak to you, it smells like
      it as well. The minister is making his opening remarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today..." you zone out and don't pay attention to what's said anymore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your thoughts drifts to your mother, and you hope that she's okay. You miss her greatly, you can't believe that it was this morning that you stepped out
      of your childhood home and left your mother behind, it feels like you've aged years since.
      You're standing here, on your wedding day. You try to keep your back straight and your head high, and not let anybody see the tears that
      are building up in the corner of your eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The minister gets to the part where you exchange of vows.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now, before God, our ancestors, and the circle of brothers and sisters gathered today, Rose Nelson and Jamir Powell will state their vows."
    </p>
    <p>
      The minister indicates for you to speak. The words that have been carved into you since before you remember. But back when you were taught these
      vows, you were a naive young girl - who thought the man you'd say these words to would be the love of your life. Your soulmate.
      A man that you'd share everything with, for the rest of your life. In your dreams the man was your age, and didn't have a wife, or children.
      You freeze for a moment, but you see your father's glare in the corner of your eye. You take a deep breathe and hesitate a moment before speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To you, my beloved, I entrust to you, alone my recipe for love. It's made with herbs from Africa, our Motherland and includes Grains of Paradise,
      to represent the haven I will create for you to come home each day; Jasmine, for the sweet spirit that will fill our lives;
      and, cayenne, for the spice that will fill our...nights." you almost choke on that last word, 'nights'.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything has happened so quickly, you
      haven't had the time to reflect over what all of this really means. You glance over at your future husband, the man that you, tonight, will
      give your virginity to. You feel nauseous again.
      The minister then turns towards your future husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And to you, my love, I offer mustard seeds, to represent the faith I have in you and in our love; allspice, because you have all
      the spice I could possibly ever need; and thyme, to represent my vow to love you forever." Jamir is grinning widely at you, he
      reminds you of a cat ready to pounce at the mouse he's caught.
    </p>
    <p>
      You force yourself to meet his eyes.
      Jamir's son comes up to you holding two plain gold wedding bands, he hands you and your future husband the rings.
      Jamir turns to you and you instinctively hold out your left hand, and he puts the ring on your finger and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "With this ring, I thee wed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then it's your turn, you grab his hand, and your fingers are shaking. Your fingers are shaking so much that you drop the ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry." you whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jamir's son bends down to pick up the ring, he cocks an eyebrow when he's standing back up, and hands you the ring again.
      This time you manage to hold onto the ring and you slowly, and shakingly, manage to thread the ring onto his finger.
      You take a deep breathe to try and keep your voice from cracking and you reciprocate:
    </p>
    <p>
      "With this ring, I thee wed."
    </p>
    <p>
      The minister is glowing when he declares:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I now pronounce you husband and wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may now kiss the bride."
    </p>
    <p>
      You try not to flinch when Jamir is leaning forward to kiss you. He smells of old sweat, and a lot of cologne - he probably put on tons of cologne
      instead of properly washing up. He grabs the back of your head and forcefully pulls you forward and kisses you on the lips - your first kiss.
      The minister opens his mouth to say a few closing remarks, and to bless your union with Jamir, but you aren't paying attention anymore.
      All your focus and energy are used to stop yourself from crying your eyes out. You want to sink through the ground and vanish. You don't know
      how you ended up in this situation. You try to tell yourself that you will be happy, but deep down you know that you won't be.
      Your dream for as long as you've remembered has been to attend university, and to be free.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wedding party doesn't amuse you at all, everything is as in a haze for you. You're staring blanky ahead of you. The drums in the background
      can't pierce your thoughts. You're looking at Jamir, sitting besides you, eating. He's a slob, there's no other way to put it. He's eating,
      drinking, laughing at jokes that his friends tell him, and he's watching the people dancing to the beating of the drums.
      You feel disgusted that this is your future, your forever after. You have no idea where you'll end up living, if he's going to keep you with him
      in the city, or if you'll end up in some village as his wife and he'll occasionally come visit, just like your father did to your family.
      All too soon the party is over, and it's time for you and your new husband to consumate your wedding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jamir leads you upstairs to his bedroom, the bedroom is quite small, but it's bigger than you're used to. You can't help to compare Jamir's townhouse,
      with your home. You and your family lived in on room and you slept on the floor. Jamir has a big bed, that has a mattress and several big fluffy pillows.
      You can't help to be in awe. He shows you where the bathroom is, and your mouth falls open. There are things in there that you've never seen before,
      you've only read and seen pictures of the things in here - toilet, shower, bathtub, and sink.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lie down" Jamir orders you.
    </p>
    <p>
      You're naked standing in front of your husband. You're embarassed, trying to cover your body with your hands.
      You've never been naked in front of anybody before, and the past year you've entered puberty and started developing curves, and you
      don't know how to feel about your own body.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lie down" Jamir repeats, more forcefully this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      You do as he's orders you, and you close your eyes. You feel tears starting to form in the corner of your eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop crying!" Jamir orders you and shakes you.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look at me" he grabs your chin and turns your face towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      You don't want to look at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      *SMACK*
    </p>
    <p>
      You gasp in shock as your cheek starts burning after Jamir's hand connecting with your cheek.
      You open your eyes, but turn your head around, and he seems satisfied with this. He doesn't hit you again.
      Your mind blanks out and you stare at an insect sitting on the wall, as you proceed to lose your virginity.
      The sharp pain makes you wince and gasp, but you don't take your eyes of the insect. You refuse to look at your
      new husband. You wish it was over. You'd read about the pain, you knew it would hurt, yet you weren't prepared
      on -how- much it would actually hurt.
      With one last guttural grunt, finishes inside you. He rolls off you, and over on his side and immediately falls asleep.
      You lay in the silence for a moment, until Jamir starts snoring. Then you dare to sit up, your throbbing and hurting.
      You quietly get out of bed and enter the bathroom, close the door behind you, and turn on the light. You gasp when you
      see the blood on the inside of your thighs.
    </p>
    <p>
      You grab a towel and turn on the tap, at another time this would have greatly fascinated you, now it's not even registering in your mind.
      You wet the towel and starts to clean yourself up. You wash of the blood, Jamir's sweat and smell. You scrub yourself hard to get the feeling
      of his skin against his away, but you can't.
    </p>
    <p>
      With your back against the door, you slowly sink to the floor. You sit there naked, with the cold floor tiles against your skin. The coolness
      piercing your bones, and a shiver runs down your spine. You know that you're not shivering because of the floor, but it helps pretending that's
      the reason. A single tear falls to the floor, a moment later followed by a another, then another. Before you know it, you're in a heap crying on the floor.
