    <h1>Do Not Call the Police</h1>
    <p>
      You see the officers, you stare at them. You watch them walk down the street and turn a corner. You can feel Callan stare a hole in
      the back of your head. You turn towards him and he visibly relaxes when he realizes that you're not going to call the police officers.
      He breaks out in a grin, and punches you on the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hey, this was a great birthday." he smiles genuinely at you, "You're truly my best friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yea, of course I am." you smile back, "Did you ever doubt that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's get back home before our mothers have heart attacks wondering where we are." Callan throws his arm around your shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      You two make your way to the bus station, and catch the last bus going back home to your village. During the entire bus ride, you can still
      smell the blood and human excrete. And every time you close your eyes, you see the scene before your eyes.
