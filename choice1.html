    <h1>Call the Police</h1>
    <p>
      "Officer!" you yell at the top of your lungs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two police officers' heads turn your way and Callan is staring at you in disbelief, but he isn't moving.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Officer! Help!" you yell again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two officers close the distance between you. Both of the officers are older, middle-aged, they are both of average height and build.
      One of them has a cigarette in the corner of his mouth. They are looking from you to Callan, and back. The one smoking notices the blood
      on Callan and raises an eyebrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is everything alright, kid?" the officer asks Callan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, officer." Callan gives him an innocent smile, "I am sorry to bother you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He hurt..." you start, all three heads turn towards you, "He raped a girl in the alley."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is the girl now?" the officer says, taking his cigarette out of his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's not injured then, or 'hurt'." the other officer sneers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is your version?" the first officer asks Callan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I met a girl at a bar, she was basically throwing herself all over me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Callan stops to think for a moment, or maybe he's just drunk. You can still feel your head spinning, and you feel sick from the scence
      that you can't erase from your mind, not matter how hard you try. The worst part is that you still have that awful smell in your nose,
      the smell of blood and excrete. You almost throw up here and now.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was she alone?" the first officer asks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yeah, she was." lies Callan before you have the chance to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was she a hooker?" the officer continues.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Damned if I know." Callan lies again.
    </p>
    <p>
      You opened your mouth to protest but no word comes out. You're just standing there, gaping. The officer nods and asks:
    </p>
    <p>
      "What happened then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She was all over me, you see officer, my father is in the army." Callan smiles at the officers who visibly relax, "And she was impressed by it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She took me out back and rubbed me over my pants." Callan grimaced, "Then she decided to change her mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was deathly silent, you could have heard a pin drop on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I took what I deserved." Callan finished and spit on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two officer grimaced and nodded. They looked at each other and then the first one said something you didn't expect to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alright, carry on boys." he turns to you, "Don't waste the time of police officers again, kid."
    </p>
    <p>
      With those words the officers turn their backs on you two and walk away, laughing. You watch them walk down the street and turn a corner.
      You can feel Callan's glare burning a hole in the back of your head. You turn around slowly to face him.
    </p>
    <p>
      *SMACK*
    </p>
    <p>
      Callan's fist connects with your jaw, and you collapse to the ground in a heap. He steps over you and spits at you.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought we were friends." his voice is ice cold and deadly, "Consider yourself lucky that I don't fuck you up."
    </p>
    <p>
      He kicks you in the ribs while you're laying on the ground. The sharp pains make you crawl up in a ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never wanna see you again 'bro'." he says and walks away from you.
    </p>
    <p>
      You lay on the ground gasping for air. Finally, you manage to get up on all fours, and then stand up. For a second your thoughts
      flash to your family, in particularly your sisters, and you worry for their safety. You vow that nothing will ever happen to them.
